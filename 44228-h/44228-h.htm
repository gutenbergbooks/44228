<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">This</span> is not a book for yacht-builders, but it is intended for
beginners in the art of boat-building, for boys and men who wish
to make something with which they may navigate the waters
of ponds, lakes, or streams. It begins with the most primitive
crafts composed of slabs or logs and works up to scows, house-boats,
skiffs, canoes and simple forms of sailing craft, a motor-boat,
and there it stops. There are so many books and magazines
devoted to the higher arts of ship-building for the graduates
to use, besides the many manufacturing houses which furnish all
the parts of a sail-boat, yacht, or motor-boat for the ambitious
boat-builder to put together himself, that it is unnecessary for the
author to invade that territory.</p>

<p>Many of the designs in this book have appeared in magazines
to which the author contributed, or in his own books on general
subjects, and all these have been successfully built by hundreds of
boys and men.</p>

<p>Many of them are the author's own inventions, and the others
are his own adaptations of well-known and long-tried models.
In writing and collecting this material for boat-builders from his
other works and placing them in one volume, the author feels that
he is fulfilling the wishes of many of his old readers and offering a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
useful book to a large audience of new recruits to the army of
those who believe in the good old American doctrine of: "If
you want a thing done, do it yourself." And by doing it yourself
you not only add to your skill and resourcefulness, but, what
is even more important, you develop your own self-reliance and
manhood.</p>

<p>No one man can think of everything connected with any one
subject, and the author gratefully acknowledges his indebtedness
to several sportsmen friends, especially to his camp-mate, Mr.
F. K. Vreeland, and his young friend, Mr. Samuel Jackson, for
suggestions of great value to both writer and reader.</p>

<h2>BOAT-BUILDING AND BOATING</h2>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>CHAPTER I<br />
<small>HOW TO CROSS A STREAM ON A LOG</small></h2>

<h3>How to Build a Logomaran</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">There</span> is a widespread notion that all wood will float on water,
and this idea often leads to laughable errors. I know a lot of
young backwoods farmers who launched a raft of green oak logs,
and were as much astonished to see their craft settle quietly to
the bottom of the lake as they would have been to see the leaden
sinkers of their fish-lines dance lightly on the surface of the waves.
The young fellows used a day's time to discover what they might
have learned in a few moments by watching the chips sink when
they struck the water as they flew from the skilful blows of their
axes.</p>

<p>The stream which cuts your trail is not always provided with
bridges of fallen trees. It may be a river too deep to ford and
too wide to be bridged by a chance log. Of course it is a simple
matter to swim, but the weather may be cold and the water still
colder; besides this, you will probably be encumbered with a
lot of camp equipage&mdash;your gun, rod, and camera&mdash;none of which
will be improved by a plunge in the water. Or it may so happen
that you are on the shores of a lake unsupplied with boats,
and you have good reasons for supposing that big fish lurk in
some particular spot out of reach from the shore. A thousand
and one emergencies may arise when a craft of some kind will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
be not only a great convenience, but almost a necessity. Under
these circumstances</p>


<h3>A Logomaran</h3>

<div class='unindent'>may be constructed in a very short time which can bear you and
your pack safely to the desired goal (<a href="#Fig_1">Fig. 1</a>).</div>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 101px;">
<img src="images/i_017a.png" width="101" height="259" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption"><a id="Fig_2"></a>Fig. 2.&mdash;The notch.</div>
</div>

<div class="figright" style="width: 347px;">
<img src="images/i_017b.png" width="347" height="464" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption"><a id="Fig_3"></a>Fig. 3.&mdash;Top view of logomaran.</div>
</div>

<p>In the Rocky, Cascade, and Selkirk Mountains, the lakes
and streams have their shores plentifully supplied with "whim
sticks," logs of fine dry timber, which the freshets have brought
down from the mountain sides and which the rocks and surging
torrents have denuded of bark. These whim sticks are of all
sizes, and as sound and perfect as kiln-dried logs. Even in the
mountains of Pennsylvania, where the lumberman's axe years ago
laid waste the primeval forest, where the saw-mills have devoured
the second growth, the tie-hunter the third growth, the excelsior-mills
and birch-beer factories the saplings, I still find good sound<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
white pine-log whim sticks strewn along the shores of the lakes
and streams, timber which is suitable for temporary rafts and
logomarans.</p>

<p>In the North Woods, where in many localities the original
forest is untouched by the devouring pulp-mills, suitable timber
is not difficult to find; so let the green wood stand and select
a log of dry wood from the shore where the floods or ice have
deposited it. Cut it into a convenient length, and with a lever
made of a good stout sapling, and a fulcrum of a stone or chunk
of wood, pry the log from its resting-place and roll it into the shallow
water. Notch the log on the upper side, as shown by <a href="#Fig_2">Fig. 2</a>,
making a notch near each end for the cross-pieces.</p>



<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="Illustrations">
<tr><td align="left"><a id="Fig_4"></a><img src="images/i_018a.png" width="336" height="147" alt="drawing" /></td>

</table></div>

<p>The two side floats may be made of pieces split, by the aid of
wooden wedges, from a large log, or composed of small whim
sticks, as shown by <a href="#Fig_3">Fig. 3</a>.</p>

<p>The floats, as may be seen by reference to <a href="#Fig_1">Figs. 1</a> and <a href="#Fig_3">3</a>, are
shorter than the middle log.</p>

<p>It is impracticable to give dimensions, for the reason that they
are relative; the length of the middle log depends, to some extent,
upon its diameter, it being evident that a thick log will support
more than a thin one of the same length; consequently if your
log is of small diameter, it must be longer, in order to support
your weight, than will be necessary for a thicker piece of timber.
The point to remember is to select a log which will support you and
your pack, and then attach two side floats to balance your craft and
prevent it from rolling over and dumping its load in the water.</p>

<p>An ordinary single shell-boat without a passenger will upset,
but when the oarsman takes his seat and grasps his long spoon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
oars, the sweeps, resting on the water, balance the cranky craft,
and it cannot upset as long as the oars are kept there. This is
the principle of the logomaran, as well as that of the common catamaran.
The cross-pieces should be only thick enough to be secure
and long enough to prevent the log from wabbling and wetting
your feet more than is necessary.</p>

</div>


<h3>If You Have an Auger and No Nails</h3>

<div class='unindent'>the craft may be fastened together with wooden pegs cut somewhat
larger than the holes bored to receive them, and driven in
with blows from your axe.</div>

<p>If you have long nails or spikes the problem is a simple one;
but if you have neither auger, nails, nor spikes you must bind the
joints with rope or hempen twine.</p>

<p>If you have neither nails, auger, nor rope, a good substitute
for the latter can be made from the long,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>


<h3>Fibrous Inner Bark</h3>

<div class='unindent'>of a dead or partly burned tree. For experiment I took some
of the inner bark of a chestnut-tree which had been killed by
fire and twisted it into a rope the size of a clothes-line, then I
allowed two strong men to have a tug-of-war with it, and the
improvised rope was stronger than the men.</div>


<h3>How to Make a Fibre Rope</h3>

<p>Take one end of a long, loose strand of fibres, give the other
end to another person, and let both twine the ends between the
fingers until the material is well twisted throughout its entire
length; then bring the two ends together, and two sides of the
loop thus made will twist themselves into a cord or rope half the
length of the original strand.</p>

<p>If you nail or peg the parts, use your axe to flatten the joints
by striking off a chip, as in <a href="#Fig_4">Fig. 4</a>.</p>

<p>If you must lash the joints together, cut them with log-cabin
notches, as in <a href="#Fig_5">Figs. 5</a> and <a href="#Fig_6">6</a>.</p>

<p>If you have baggage to transport, make</p>


<h3>A Dunnage Crib</h3>

<div class='unindent'>by driving four stakes in cuts made near the end of the centre
log and binding them with rope or fibre (<a href="#Fig_7">Figs. 7</a> and <a href="#Fig_8">8</a>), or by
working green twigs basket-fashion around them, or make the
rack saw-buck fashion, as shown by <a href="#Fig_7">Fig. 7</a>, and this will keep
your things above water.</div>

<p>A couple of cleats nailed on each side of the log will be of
great assistance and lessen the danger and insecurity of the footing.</p>

<p>A skilfully made logomaran will enable you to cross any
stream with a moderate current and any small lake in moderate
weather. It is not an especially dry craft, but it won't sink or
upset, and will take one but a short time to knock it together.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II<br />
<small>HOME-MADE BOATS</small></h2>



<div class='summary2'>Birth of the "Man-Friday" Catamaran&mdash;The Crusoe Raft and
Chump Rafts</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Not</span> so very many years ago I remember visiting, in company
with my cousin Tom, a small lake at the headwaters of the
Miami. High and precipitous cliffs surround the little body of
water. So steep were the great weather-beaten rocks that it
was only where the stream came tumbling down past an old
mill that an accessible path then existed. Down that path Tom
and I scrambled, for we knew that large bass lurked in the deep,
black holes among the rocks.</p>

<p>We had no jointed split-bamboo rods nor fancy tackle, but
the fish there in those days were not particular and seldom
hesitated to bite at an angle-worm or grasshopper though the
hook upon which the bait squirmed was suspended by a coarse
line from a freshly cut hickory sapling.</p>

<p>Even now I feel the thrill of excitement and expectancy as,
in imagination, my pole is bent nearly double by the frantic struggles
of those "gamy" black bass. After spending the morning
fishing we built a fire upon a short stretch of sandy beach, and
cleaning our fish and washing them in the spring close at hand,
we put them among the embers to cook.</p>

<p>While the fire was getting our dinner ready for us we threw
off our clothes and plunged into the cool waters of the lake. Inexpert
swimmers as we were at that time, the opposite shore,
though apparently only a stone's throw distant, was too far off
for us to reach by swimming. Many a longing and curious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
glance we cast toward it, however, and strong was the temptation
that beset us to try the unknown depths intervening. A
pair of brown ears appeared above the ferns near the water's
edge, and a fox peeped at us; squirrels ran about the fallen
trunks of trees or scampered up the rocks as saucily as though
they understood that we could not swim well enough to reach
their side of the lake; and high up the face of the cliff was a dark
spot which we almost knew to be the entrance to some mysterious
cavern.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 678px;">
<img src="images/i_022.png" width="678" height="305" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption"><a id="Fig_8_5"></a>Fig. 8½.&mdash;The Man-Friday.</div>
</div>

<p>How we longed for a boat! But not even a raft nor a dugout
could be seen anywhere upon the glassy surface of the water
or along its rocky border. We nevertheless determined to explore
the lake next day, even if we should have to paddle astride
of a log.</p>

<p>The first rays of the morning sun had not reached the dark
waters before my companion and I were hard at work, with axe
and hatchet, chopping in twain a long log we had discovered
near the mill. We had at first intended to build a raft; but
gradually we evolved a sort of catamaran. The two pieces of
log we sharpened at the ends for the bow; then we rolled the
logs down upon the beach, and while I went into the thicket to
chop down some saplings my companion borrowed an auger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
from the miller. We next placed the logs about three feet
apart, and marking the points where we intended to put the
cross-pieces, we cut notches there; then we placed the saplings
across, fitting them into these notches. To hold them securely
we bored holes down through the sapling cross-pieces into the
logs; with the hatchet we hammered wooden pegs into these
holes. For the seat we used the half of a section of log, the flat
side fitting into places cut for that purpose. All that remained
to be done now was to make a seat in the stern and a pair of
rowlocks. At a proper distance from the oarsman's seat we
bored two holes for a couple of forked sticks, which answered
admirably for rowlocks; across the stern we fastened another
piece of log similar to that used for the oarsman's seat (<a href="#Fig_8_5">Fig. 8½</a>).
With the help of a man from the mill our craft was launched;
and with a pair of oars made of old pine boards we rowed off,
leaving the miller waving his hat.</p>

<p>Our catamaran was not so light as a row-boat, but it floated,
and we could propel it with the oars, and, best of all, it was our
own invention and made with our own hands. We called it a
"Man-Friday," and by its means we explored every nook in
the length and breadth of the lake; and ever afterward when
we wanted a boat we knew a simple and inexpensive way to
make one&mdash;and a safe one, too.</p>


<h3>The Crusoe Raft</h3>

<div class='unindent'>is another rustic craft, but it is of more ambitious dimensions
than the "Man-Friday." Instead of being able to float only
one or two passengers, the "Crusoe," if properly built, ought
to accommodate a considerable party of raftsmen. Of course
the purpose for which the raft is to be used, and the number of
the crew that is expected to man it, must be taken into consideration
when deciding upon the dimensions of the proposed craft.</div>

<p>All the tools that are necessary for the construction of a good
stout raft are an axe, an auger, and a hatchet, with some strong
arms to wield them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>The building material can be gathered from any driftwood
heap on lake or stream.</p>

<p>For a moderate-sized raft collect six or seven logs, the longest
not being over sixteen feet in length nor more than a foot in
diameter; the logs must be tolerably straight. Pick out the
longest and biggest for the centre, sharpen one end, roll the
log into the water, and there secure it.</p>

<p>Select two logs as nearly alike as possible, to lie one at each
side of the centre log. Measure the centre log, and make the
point of each side log, not at its own centre, but at that side of
it which will lie against the middle log, so that this side point
shall terminate where the pointing of the middle log begins (see
<a href="#Fig_9">Fig. 9</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 513px;">

<div class="caption"><a id="Fig_9"></a>Fig. 9.&mdash;Plan of Crusoe raft.</div>
</div>

<p>After all the logs needed have been trimmed and sharpened
in the manner just described, roll them into the water and arrange
them in order (<a href="#Fig_9">Fig. 9</a>). Fasten them together with "cross-strips,"
boring holes through the strips to correspond with holes
bored into the logs lying beneath, and through these holes drive
wooden pegs. The pegs should be a trifle larger than the holes;
the water will cause the pegs to swell, and they will hold much
more firmly than iron nails.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>The skeleton of the cabin can be made of saplings; such as
are used for hoop-poles are the best.</p>

<p>These are each bent into an arch, and the ends are thrust
into holes bored for that purpose. Over this hooping a piece of
canvas is stretched, after the manner of old-fashioned country
wagons (<a href="#Fig_10">Figs. 10</a> and <a href="#Fig_11">11</a>).</p>

<p>Erect a "jack-staff," to be used as a flag-pole or a mast to
rig a square sail on.</p>

<p>A stout stick should be erected at the stern, and a similar
one upon each side of the raft near the bow; these sticks, when
their ends are made smaller, as shown in the illustration (<a href="#Fig_10">Fig.
10</a>), serve as rowlocks.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 522px;">

<div class="caption"><a id="Fig_12"></a>Fig. 12.&mdash;Sweeps.</div>
</div>

<p>For oars use "sweeps"&mdash;long poles, each with a piece of board
for a blade fastened at one end (<a href="#Fig_12">Fig. 12</a>).</p>

<p>Holes must be bored through the poles of the sweeps about
three feet from the handle, to slip over the pegs used as rowlocks,
as described above. These pegs should be high enough
to allow the oarsman to stand while using the sweeps.</p>

<p>A flat stone or earth box placed at the bow will serve as a fireplace.</p>

<p>If the cracks between the logs under the cabin are filled up
to prevent the water splashing through, and the cabin is floored
with cross-sticks, a most comfortable bed at night can be made of
hay, by heaping it under the canvas cover in sufficient quantities.</p>

<p>The Crusoe raft has this great advantage over all boats: you
may take a long trip down the river, allowing the current to bear
you along, using the sweeps only to assist the man at the helm
(rear sweep); then, after your excursion is finished you may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
abandon your raft and return by steam-boat or train. A very
useful thing to the swimmers, when they are skylarking in the
water, is</p>


<h3>The Chump's Raft</h3>

<p>Its construction is simple. Four boards, each about six feet
long, are nailed together in the form of a square, with the ends
of the boards protruding, like the figure drawn upon a school-boy's
slate for the game of "Tit, tat, toe" (<a href="#Fig_13">Fig. 13</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 266px;">

<div class="caption"><a id="Fig_13"></a>Fig. 13.&mdash;The chump's raft.</div>
</div>

<p>All nail-points must be knocked off and the heads hammered
home, to prevent serious scratches and wounds on the bather's
body when he clambers over the raft or slips off in an attempt to
do so (<a href="#Fig_14">Fig. 14</a>).</p>

<p>Beginners get in the middle hole, and there, with a support
within reach all around them, they can venture with comparative
safety in deep water.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 14.&mdash;A beginner in a chump's raft.</div>
</div>

<p>The raft, which I built as a model fifteen years ago, is still in
use at my summer camp, where scores of young people have
used it with a success proved by their present skill as swimmers.
But many camps are located in a section of the country<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
where boards are as scarce as boarding-houses, but where timber,
in its rough state, exists in abundance. The campers in such
locations can make</p>


<h3>A Chump's Raft of Logs</h3>

<div class="caption">Fig. 16.&mdash;Side view of chump's log raft.</div>
</div>

<p>Such a float consists of two dried logs fastened together at each
end by cross-slabs, so as to form a rude catamaran. These rafts
can be towed through deep water by a canoe or row-boat, with
the tenderfoot securely swung in a sling between the logs, where
he may practice the hand-and-foot movement with a sense of
security which only the certainty that he is surrounded by a
wooden life-preserver will give him. <a href="#Fig_15">Fig. 15</a> shows a top view
of the new chump's raft. In <a href="#Fig_16">Fig. 16</a> the two logs are connected
fore and aft by cross-slabs; two more upright slabs are nailed
securely to the side of the logs; notches having been cut in the
top ends of these slabs, a stout cross-piece is securely nailed to
them and the towel or rope sling suspended from the middle of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
the cross-piece. In regard to the dimensions of the raft it is only
necessary to say that it should be wide and long enough to allow
free movement of the arms and legs of the pupil who is suspended
between the logs. In almost every wilderness stream there can
be found piles of driftwood on the shore where one may select
good, dried, well-seasoned pine or spruce logs from which to
make rafts. If such heaps of driftwood are not within reach, look
for some standing dead timber and select that which is of sufficient
dimensions to support a swimmer, and be careful that it is
not hollow or rotten in the core. Rotten wood will soon become
water-logged and heavy. <a href="#Fig_17">Fig. 17</a> shows the position of the
swimmer supported by the chump's sling. If your raft has a
tendency to work so that one log pulls ahead of the other, it may
be braced by cross-pieces, such as are shown at J and K in <a href="#Fig_18">Fig.
18</a>. This figure also shows supports for a suspension pole made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
by nailing two sticks to each side and allowing the ends to cross
so as to form a crotch in which the supporting rod rests and to
which it is securely fastened by nails, or by being bound there by
a piece of rope, as in A, <a href="#Fig_19">Fig. 19</a>. B, <a href="#Fig_19">Fig. 19</a>, shows the crotch
made by resting L in a fork on the M stick and then nailing or
binding it in place. C, <a href="#Fig_19">Fig. 19</a>, shows the two sticks, L and M,
joined by notches cut log-cabin fashion before they are nailed
in place.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III<br />
<small>A RAFT THAT WILL SAIL</small></h2>

<div class='summary1'>The Raft is Just the Thing for Camp Life&mdash;Pleasurable Occupation
for a Camping Party Where Wood is Plentiful&mdash;You
Will Need Axes and Hatchets and a Few Other Civilized
Implements</div>


<p><span class="smcap">First</span> we will select two pine logs of equal length, and, while
the water is heating for our coffee, we will sharpen the butt, or
larger end, of the logs on one side with the axe, making a "chisel
edge," as shown in <a href="#Fig_20">Fig. 20</a>. This gives us an appetite for breakfast
and makes the big fish in the lake, as they jump above the
water, cast anxious looks toward our camp.</p>

<p>Breakfast finished, we will cut some cross-pieces to join our
two logs together, and at equal distances apart we will bore holes
through the cross-pieces for peg-holes (<a href="#Fig_21">Figs. 21</a>, <a href="#Fig_22">22</a>, and <a href="#Fig_23">23</a>).
While one of the party is fashioning a number of pegs, each with
a groove in one side, like those shown in <a href="#Fig_24">Fig. 24</a>, the others will
roll the logs into the water and secure them in a shallow spot.</p>

<p>Shoes and stockings must be removed, for most of the work
is now to be done in the water. Of course, it would be much
easier done on land, but the raft will be very heavy and could
never be launched unless under the most favorable circumstances.
It is better to build the craft in the element which is to be its home.</p>

<p>Cut two long saplings for braces, and after separating the logs
the proper distance for your cross-pieces to fit, nail your braces
in position, as represented by <a href="#Fig_20">Fig. 20</a>.</p>


<div class="figcenter" style="width: 640px;"><a id="Fig_20"></a><a id="Fig_21"></a><a id="Fig_22"></a><a id="Fig_23"></a><a id="Fig_24"></a><a id="Fig_25"></a><a id="Fig_26"></a><a id="Fig_27"></a><a id="Fig_28"></a>

with middle and stern strut in place. Fig. 26.&mdash;Springs for dry deck. Fig. 27.&mdash;Dry deck.
Fig. 28.&mdash;Dry deck in place</div>
</div>



<p>This holds the logs steady, and we may now lay the two cross-pieces
in position, and mark the points on the logs carefully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a><br /><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
where the holes are to be bored to correspond with the ones in
the cross-pieces. Bore the holes in one log first; make the holes
deep enough and then fill them with water, after which drive
the pegs through the ends of the cross-pieces and into the log.
The grooves in the pegs (<a href="#Fig_24">Fig. 24</a>) will allow the water to escape
from the holes and the water will cause the peg to swell and
tighten its hold on the log and cross-pieces.</p>

<p>Now bore holes in the other log under those in the cross-pieces
and fill them with water before driving the pegs home, as you
did in the first instance. <a href="#Fig_25">Fig. 25</a> is a Man-Friday raft.</p>


<h3>The Deck</h3>

<p>Before placing the bow in position we must go ashore and
make a dry deck. Selecting for the springs two long green ash
or hickory poles, trim the ends off flat on one side, as shown by
<a href="#Fig_26">Fig. 26</a>. This flat side is the bottom, so roll them over, with the
flat side toward the ground, and if you can find no planks or
barrel staves for a deck, split in half a number of small logs and
peg or nail them on the top side of the springs, as in <a href="#Fig_27">Fig. 27</a>.</p>

<p>Now all hands must turn out and carry the deck down to the
raft and place it in position, with the flattened sides of the springs
resting on top of the logs at the bow. Prop it up in this position,
and then bore holes through the springs into the logs and peg
the springs down. Over the flat ends place the heavy bow cross-piece,
bore the peg-holes, and fasten it in position (<a href="#Fig_28">Fig. 28</a>).</p>

<p>In the centre of the bow cross-piece bore several holes close
together and chip out the wood between to make a hole, as square
a one as possible, for the mast to fit or "step" in. With the wood
from a packing-box or a slab from a log make the bench for the
mast.</p>

<p>Bore a hole through the bench a trifle astern of the step, or
hole, for the mast below. It will cause the mast to "rake" a
little "aft." You have done a big day's work, but a couple of
days ought to be sufficient time to finish the craft.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 526px;"><a id="Fig_29"></a>

<div class="caption">Fig. 29.&mdash;Sail for Man-Friday.</div>
</div>

<h3>The Sail</h3>



<p>Turn over the raw edges of the old sail-cloth and stitch them
down, as in <a href="#Fig_29">Fig. 29</a>&mdash;that is, if you have the needle and thread
for the purpose; if not, trim the cloth to the proper form and two
inches from the luff (the side next to the mast). Cut a number
of holes; these should be stitched like button-holes, if possible,
but if the sail-cloth is tough and we have no needle, we shall have
to let them go unstitched. A small loop of rope must be sewed
or fastened in some other manner very securely to each corner of
the sail.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>From spruce pine or an old fishing-pole make a sprit, and of a
good, straight piece of pine manufacture your mast somewhat
longer than the luff of the sail (<a href="#Fig_29">Fig. 29</a>).</p>

<p>Through the eyelets lace the luff of the sail to the mast, so that
its lower edge will clear the dry deck by about a foot.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><a id="Fig_30"></a>
<img src="images/i_035.png" width="600" height="502" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 30.&mdash;Scudding before the wind.</div>
</div>

<p>Through the hole made for the purpose in the bench (<a href="#Fig_30">Fig. 30</a>)
thrust the mast into the step, or socket, that we have cut in the
bow cross-piece. Tie to the loop at the bottom corner of the sail
a strong line about twelve feet long for a sheet with which to
control the sail.</p>

<p>Trim the upper end of the sprit to fit in the loop at the upper
outer corner of the sail, and make a notch in the lower end to fit
in the loop of the line called the "snotter."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>Now, as you can readily see, when the sprit is pushed diagonally
upward the sail is spread; to hold it in place make a loop of line
for a "snotter" and attach the loop to the mast, as in Figs. 29
and 30. Fit the loop in the notch in the lower end of the sprit,
and the sail is set.</p>


<h3>The Keelig</h3>

<p>We need anchors, one for the bow and one for the stern. It
takes little time to make them, as you only need a forked stick,
a stone, and a piece of plank, or, better still, a barrel stave.
Figs. 35 to 39 show how this is made. Down East the fishermen
use the "keelig" in preference to any other anchor.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 550px;"><a id="Fig_31"></a><a id="Fig_32"></a><a id="Fig_33"></a><a id="Fig_34"></a><a id="Fig_35"></a><a id="Fig_36"></a><a id="Fig_37"></a><a id="Fig_38"></a><a id="Fig_39"></a>
<img src="images/i_036.png" width="550" height="451" alt="Figures 31-39" />
</div>



<p>Make fast your lines to the "keelig" thus: Take the end of
the rope in your right hand and the standing part (which is the
part leading from the boat) in your left hand and form the loop
(A, <a href="#Fig_31">Fig. 31</a>).</p>

<p>Then with the left hand curve the cable from you, bringing
the end through the loop, as in B, <a href="#Fig_32">Fig. 32</a>; then lead it around
and down, as in C, <a href="#Fig_33">Fig. 33</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>Draw it tight, as in D, <a href="#Fig_34">Fig. 34</a>, and you have the good, old-fashioned
knot, called by sailors the "bow-line."</p>

<p>To make it look neat and shipshape you may take a piece of
string and bind the standing part to the shaft of your anchor or
keelig&mdash;keelek&mdash;killick&mdash;killeck&mdash;kelleck&mdash;kellock&mdash;killock, etc.,
as you may choose to spell it.</p>

<p>A paddle to steer with and two pegs in the stern cross-piece
to rest it in complete the craft; and now the big bass had better
use due caution, because our lines will reach their haunts, and
we are after them!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV<br />
<small>CANOES</small></h2>

<div class='summary1'>The Advantages of a Canoe&mdash;How to Make the Slab Canoe and
the Dugout&mdash;How to Make a Siwash and a White Man's
Dugout</div>


<p><span class="smcap">There</span> are many small freak crafts invented each year, but
none of them has any probabilities of being popularly used as
substitutes for the old models.</p>

<p>Folding canoes, as a rule, are cranky, but the writer has found
them most convenient when it was necessary to transport them
long distances overland. They are not, however, the safest of
crafts; necessarily they lack the buoyant wooden frame and lining
of the ordinary canvas canoe, which enables it to float even when
filled with water.</p>

<p>The author owes his life to the floating properties of his canvas
canoe. On one occasion when it upset in a driving easterly
storm the wind was off shore, and any attempt upon the canoeist's
part to swim toward shore would have caused him to have been
suffocated by the tops of the waves which the wind cut off, driving
the water with stinging force into his face so constantly that,
in order to breathe at all, he had to face the other way. He was
at length rescued by a steamer, losing nothing but the sails and
his shoes. Nevertheless, the same storm which capsized his
little craft upset several larger boats and tore the sails from
others.</p>

<p>The advantages of a good canoe are many for the young navigators:
they can launch their own craft, pick it up when occasion
demands and carry it overland. It is safe in experienced hands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
in any weather which is fit for out-door amusement. When you
are "paddling your own canoe" you are facing to the front and
can see what is ahead of you, which is much safer and more
pleasant than travelling backward, like a crawfish.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 506px;"><a id="Fig_40"></a>

<div class="caption">Fig. 40.</div>
</div>

<p>The advance-guard of modern civilization is the lumberman,
and following close on his heels comes the all-devouring saw-mill.
This fierce creature has an abnormal appetite for logs,
and it keeps an army of men, boys, and horses busy in supplying
it with food. While it supplies us with lumber for the carpenter,
builder, and cabinet-maker, it at the same time, in the most
shameful way, fills the trout streams and rivers with great
masses of sawdust, which kills and drives away the fish. But
near the saw-mill there is always to be found material for a</p>


<h3>Slab Canoe</h3>

<div class='unindent'>which consists simply of one of those long slabs, the first cut
from some giant log (<a href="#Fig_43">Fig. 43</a>).</div>

<p>These slabs are burned or thrown away by the mill-owners,
and hence cost nothing; and as the saw-mill is in advance of
population, you are most likely to run across one on a hunting
or fishing trip.</p>

<p>Near one end, and on the flat side of the slab (<a href="#Fig_40">Fig. 40</a>), bore
four holes, into which drive the four legs of a stool made of a section
of a smaller slab (<a href="#Fig_41">Fig. 41</a>), and your boat is ready to launch.
From a piece of board make a double or single paddle (<a href="#Fig_42">Fig. 42</a>),
and you are equipped for a voyage. An old gentleman, who in
his boyhood days on the frontier frequently used this simple
style of canoe, says that the speed it makes will compare favorably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
with that of many a more pretentious vessel. See <a href="#Fig_43">Fig. 43</a>
for furnished boat.</p>


<h3>The Dugout</h3>

<p>Although not quite as delicate in model or construction as
the graceful birch-bark canoe, the "dugout" of the Indians is a
most wonderful piece of work, when we consider that it is carved
from the solid trunk of a giant tree with the crudest of tools, and
is the product of savage labor.</p>

<p>Few people now living have enjoyed the opportunity of seeing
one built by the Indians, and, as the author is not numbered
among that select few, he considers it a privilege to be able to
quote the following interesting account given by Mr. J. H. Mallett,
of Helena.</p>


<h3>How to Build a Siwash Canoe</h3>

<p>"While visiting one of the small towns along Puget Sound,
I was greatly interested in the way the Indians built their canoes.
It is really wonderful how these aborigines can, with the crudest
means and with a few days' work, convert an unwieldy log into
a trim and pretty canoe.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 43.&mdash;Slab canoe.</div>
</div>

<p>"One Monday morning I saw a buck building a fire at the base
of a large cedar-tree, and he told me that this was the first step
in the construction of a canoe that he intended to use upon the
following Saturday. He kept the fire burning merrily all that
day and far into the night, when a wind came up and completed
the downfall of the monarch of the forest. The next day the
man arose betimes, and, borrowing a cross-cut saw from a logger,
cut the trunk of the tree in twain at a point some fifteen feet
from where it had broken off, and then with a dull hatchet he
hacked away until the log had assumed the shape of the desired
canoe. In this work he was helped by his squaw. The old fellow
then built a fire on the upper part of the log, guiding the course
of the fire with daubs of clay, and in due course of time the interior
of the canoe had been burned out. Half a day's work with
the hatchet rendered the inside smooth and shapely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>"The canoe was now, I thought, complete, though it appeared
to be dangerously narrow of beam. This the Indian soon remedied.
He filled the shell two-thirds full of water, and into the
fluid he dropped half a dozen stones that had been heating in
the fire for nearly a day. The water at once attained a boiling
point, and so softened the wood that the buck and squaw
were enabled to draw out the sides and thus supply the necessary
breadth of beam. Thwarts and slats were then placed in
the canoe and the water and stones thrown out. When the
steamed wood began to cool and contract, the thwarts held it
back, and the sides held the thwarts, and there the canoe was
complete, without a nail, joint, or crevice, for it was made of one
piece of wood. The Siwash did not complete it as soon as he
had promised, but it only took him eight days."</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 44.&mdash;The dugout.</div>
</div>

<p>In the North-eastern part of our country, before the advent
of the canvas canoe, beautiful and light birch-bark craft were
used by the Indians, the voyagers, trappers, and white woodsmen.
But in the South and in the North-west, the dugout takes
the place of the birch-bark. Among the North-western Indians
the dugouts are made from the trunks of immense cedar-trees
and built with high, ornamental bows, which are brilliantly
decorated with paint. On the eastern shore of Maryland and
Virginia the dugout is made into a sail-boat called the buck-eye,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
or bug-eye. But all through the Southern States, from the Ohio
River to the Gulf of Mexico and in Mexico, the dugout is made
of a hollowed log after the manner of an ordinary horse trough,
and often it is as crude as the latter, but it can be made almost
as beautiful and graceful as a birch-bark canoe.</p>


<h3>How to Make a White Man's Dugout Canoe</h3>

<p>To make one of these dugout canoes one must be big and
strong enough to wield an axe, but if the readers are too young
for this work, they are none too young to know how to make
one, and their big brothers and father can do the work. Since
the dugout occupies an important position in the history of our
country, every boy scout should know how it is made.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig_44">Fig. 44</a> shows one of these canoes afloat; <a href="#Fig_45">Fig. 45</a> shows a tall,
straight tree suitable for our purpose, and it also shows how the
tree is cut and the arrangement of the kerfs, or two notches, so that
it will fall in the direction of the arrow in the diagram. You will
notice along the ground are shown the ends of a number of small
logs. These are the skids, or rollers, upon which the log will rest
when the tree is cut and felled. The tree will fall in the direction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
in which the arrow is pointed if there is no wind. If you have
never cut down a tree, be careful to take some lessons of a good
woodsman before you attempt it.</p>

<p>When the log is trimmed off at both ends like <a href="#Fig_46">Fig. 46</a>, flatten
the upper side with the axe. This is for the bottom of the canoe;
the flat part should be about a foot and a half wide to extend
from end to end of the log. Now, with some poles for pryers,
turn your log over so that it will rest with the flat bottom on the
skids, as in <a href="#Fig_46">Fig. 46</a>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 416px;"><div class="caption"><a id="Fig_46"></a>Fig. 46.</div>
<img src="images/i_044.png" width="416" height="178" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption"><a id="Fig_47"></a>Fig. 47.</div>
</div>


<p>Next take a chalk-line and fasten it at the two ends of the log,
as shown by the dotted line in <a href="#Fig_46">Figs. 46</a>, <a href="#Fig_47">47</a>, <a href="#Fig_48">48</a>, <a href="#Fig_49">49</a>.</p>

<p>Snap the line so that it will make a straight mark as shown
by the dotted line; then trim off the two ends for the bow and
stern, as shown in <a href="#Fig_47">Fig. 47</a>. Next cut notches down to the dotted
line, as illustrated in <a href="#Fig_48">Fig. 48</a>; then cut away from the bow down
to the first notch, making a curved line, as shown in <a href="#Fig_49">Fig. 49</a>
(which is cut to second notch). Do the same with the stern,
making duplicates of the bow and stern. The spaces between
the notches amidships may now be split off by striking your axe
along the chalk-line and then carefully driving in wooden wedges.
When this is all done you will have <a href="#Fig_50">Fig. 50</a>. You can now turn the
log over and trim off the edges of the bow and stern so that they
will slope, as shown in <a href="#Fig_44">Fig. 44</a>, in a rounded curve; after which
roll the canoe back again upon its bottom and with an adze and
axe hollow out the inside, leaving some solid wood at both bow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
and stern&mdash;not that you need the wood for strength, but to save
labor. When you have decided upon the thickness of the sides
of your canoe, take some small, pointed instrument, like an awl,
for instance, and make holes with it to the required depth at intervals
along the sides and bottom of the canoe. Then take some
small sticks (as long as the canoe sides are to be thick), make them
to fit the holes, blacken their ends, and drive them into the holes.</p>

<p>As soon as you see one from the inside, you will know that
you have made the shell thin enough. Use a jack-plane to smooth
it off inside and out; then build a big fire and heat some stones.
Next fill the canoe with water and keep dumping the hot stones
in the water until the latter is almost or quite to boiling point.
The hot water will soften the wood so that the sides will become
flexible, and you can then fit in some braces at the bow, stern, and
centre of the canoe. Make the centre brace or seat some inches
wider than the log, so that when it is forced in place it will spread
the canoe in the middle.</p>

to Build an Umbrella Canoe&mdash;How Old Shells Can be
Turned into Boys' Boats&mdash;Cause of Upsets&mdash;Landing from,
and Embarking in, a Shell&mdash;How to Mend Checks and Cracks</div>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> making canoes the Indians used birch bark for the cover,
rock maple for the cross-bars, and white cedar for the rest of the
frame. We will substitute canvas for the birch bark and any old
wood that we can for the rock maple and the white cedar. <i>Real
woodcraft is best displayed in the ability to use the material at
hand.</i></p>

<p>David Abercrombie, the outfitter, some time ago presented
Andrew J. Stone, the Arctic explorer and mighty hunter, with a
small piece of light, water-proof cloth to use as a shelter tent in
bad weather. But Stone, like the hunter that he was, slept unprotected
on the mountain side in the sleet and driving storms,
and used the water-proof cloth to protect the rare specimens he
had shot. One day a large, rapid torrent lay in his path; there
was no lumber large enough with which to build a raft, and the
only wood for miles around was small willow bushes growing
along the river bank. At his command, his three Indians made
a canoe frame of willow sticks, tied together with bits of cloth
and string. Stone set this frame in the middle of his water-proof
cloth, tied the cloth over the frame with other pieces of string,
and using only small clubs for paddles, he and his men crossed
the raging torrent in this makeshift, which was loaded with their
guns, camera, and specimens that he had shot on the trip.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>After reading the above there is no doubt the reader will be
able to build a war canoe with barrel-hoop ribs and lattice-work
slats. In the writer's studio is a long piece of maple, one and
one-half inches wide and one-quarter inch thick, which was left
by the workmen when they put down a hard-wood floor. If you
can get some similar strips, either of oak, maple, or birch, from the
dealers in flooring material, they will not be expensive and will
make splendid gunwales for your proposed canoe. There should
be four such strips. The hard-wood used for flooring splits easily,
and holes should be bored for the nails or screws to prevent cracking
the wood when the nails or screws are driven home. <a href="#Fig_51">Fig. 51</a>
shows the framework (side view) of the canoe; <a href="#Fig_52">Fig. 52</a> shows
an end view of the same canoe; <a href="#Fig_53">Fig. 53</a> shows the middle section,
and <a href="#Fig_54">Fig. 54</a> shows the form of the bow and stern sections. This
boat may be built any length you wish, and so that you may
get the proper proportions, the diagrams from one to five are
marked off in equal divisions. To make patterns of the moulds,
<a href="#Fig_53">Figs. 53</a> and <a href="#Fig_54">54</a>, take a large piece of manila paper, divide it up
into the same number of squares as the diagram, make the squares
any size you may decide upon, and then trace the line, 1-H-10,
as it is in the diagrams. This will give you the patterns of the
two moulds (<a href="#Fig_53">Figs. 53</a> and <a href="#Fig_54">54</a>). While you are looking at these
figures, it may be well to call your attention to the way bow and
stern pieces are made. In <a href="#Fig_63">Fig. 63</a> the pieces Y and X are made
from pieces of a packing-box, notched and nailed together with
a top piece, U, and a brace, V.</p>

<div class="caption">Conventional bow, but made of barrel-heads.</div>
</div>



<p>The other end of the same canoe is, as you may see, strengthened
and protected by having a barrel-hoop tacked over the
stem-pieces, Y, X, U. In <a href="#Fig_64">Fig. 64</a> we use different material;
here the stem-piece is made of a broken bicycle rim, U, braced
by the pieces of packing-box, Y, V, and W. The left-hand end
of <a href="#Fig_64">Fig. 64</a> is made with pieces of head of a barrel, X and U.
The bottom of the stem-piece Y is made of the piece of a packing-box.
The two braces V are parts of the barrel-stave. <a href="#Fig_60">Fig. 60</a>
shows the common form of the bow of a canoe. The stem-pieces<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a><br /><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
X, Y are made of the parts of the head of a barrel, as shown in
<a href="#Fig_62">Fig. 62</a>. To make a stem from a barrel-head, nail the two
pieces X and Y, <a href="#Fig_56">Fig. 56</a>, together as shown in this particular
diagram. Now take another piece of barrel-head, <a href="#Fig_57">Fig. 57</a>, and
saw off a piece, A´, D´, C´, so that it will fit neatly over A, C, D,
on <a href="#Fig_56">Fig. 56</a>. Nail this securely in place, and then in the same
manner cut another piece to fit over the part E, C, B, and nail
that in place. Use small nails, but let them be long enough so
that you may clinch them by holding an axe or an iron against the
head while you hammer the protruding points down, or drive the
nail a little on the bias and holding the axe or iron on the side it is
to come through and let it strike the nail as it comes out and it
will clinch itself. To fasten the stem-piece to the keel use two
pieces of packing-box or board, cut in the form of <a href="#Fig_58">Fig. 58</a>, and
nail these securely to the bow-piece as in Z, in <a href="#Fig_60">Fig. 60</a>. Then
from the bottom side of the keel H, nail the keel-pieces firmly to
the keel as in <a href="#Fig_61">Fig. 61</a>. Also drive some nails from Z to the top
down to the keel, as shown by the dotted lines in <a href="#Fig_60">Fig. 60</a>. The
end view, <a href="#Fig_59">Fig. 59</a>, shows how the two Z pieces hug and support
the stem-piece on the keel H. <a href="#Fig_55">Fig. 55</a> shows a half of the top
view of the canoe gunwales; the dimensions, marked in feet and
inches, are taken from an Indian birch-bark canoe. You see
by the diagram that it is eight feet from the centre of the middle
cross-piece to the end of the big opening at the bow. It is also
three feet from the centre of the middle cross-piece to the next
cross-piece, and thirty inches from the centre of that cross-piece
to the bow cross-piece, which is just thirty inches from the eight-foot
mark. The middle cross-piece in a canoe of these dimensions
is seven-eighths of an inch thick, and thirty inches long between
the gunwales; the next cross-piece is three-quarters of an
inch thick and twenty-two and one-half inches long. The next
one is half an inch wide, two inches thick and twelve inches between
the gunwales. These cross-pieces can be made of the
staves of a barrel. Of course, this would be a canoe of sixteen
feet inside measurement, not counting the flattened part of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
bow and stern. Now, then, to build the canoe. First take the
keel-piece, H, which is in this case a piece of board about six
inches wide and only thick enough to be moderately stiff. Lay
the keel on any level surface and put the stem-pieces on as already
described, using packing-box for X, U, V, Y, and Z, and
bracing them with a piece of packing-box on each side, marked
W in diagram (<a href="#Fig_51">Fig. 51</a>). Then make three moulds, one for the
centre (<a href="#Fig_53">Fig. 53</a>), and two more for the bow and stern (<a href="#Fig_54">Fig. 54</a>).
Notch the bottom of these moulds to fit the keel and with wire
nails make them fast to the keel, leaving the ends of the nails
protruding far enough to be easily withdrawn when you wish
to remove the moulds. In nailing the laths to the moulds (<a href="#Fig_51">Fig. 51</a>)
leave the heads of the nails also protruding so that they may be
removed. Place the moulds in position, with the middle one in
the exact centre, and the two ends located like those in <a href="#Fig_63">Figs. 63</a>
and <a href="#Fig_64">64</a>. Place and nail gunwale, L, on as in <a href="#Fig_51">Fig. 51</a>, tacking
it to the bow and stern and bending it around to fit the moulds;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
tack the lattice slats M, N, O, P on to the bow, stern, and
moulds, as shown in <a href="#Fig_51">Fig. 51</a>.</p>

<p>If your barrel-hoops are stiff and liable to break while bending
and unbending, let them soak a couple of days in a tub of water,
then before fitting them to the form of the canoe make them more
pliable by pouring hot water on them. The barrel-hoop S, R,
at the bow of the canoe, is nailed to the top-piece U, to the inside
of the slats L, M, N, O, P, and to the outside of H. The next
three ribs on each side are treated in the same manner; repeat
this at the other end of the canoe and nail the intervening ribs
to the top of H and to the inside of the slats, following the model
of the boat. Put the ribs about four inches apart and clinch the
nails as already described.</p>

<p>In the diagrams there is no temporary support for the canoe
frame except the wooden horses, as in <a href="#Fig_51">Fig. 51</a>. These supports
have been purposely omitted in the drawing, as it is desirable to
keep it as simple as possible. Some temporary support will be
necessary to hold the bow and stern-piece in <a href="#Fig_51">Fig. 51</a>. These
supports can be nailed or screwed temporarily to the canoe frame
so as to hold it rigid while you are at work on it.</p>

<p>After the ribs are all in place and the framework completed,
turn the canoe upside down upon the wooden horses&mdash;for a canoe
as large as the one in the first diagram you will need three horses,
one at each end and one in the middle. For a canoe of the dimensions
marked in <a href="#Fig_55">Fig. 55</a>, that is, sixteen feet inside measurement,
you would need about seven yards of ten-ounce cotton canvas,
of sufficient width to reach up over the sides of your canoe. Take
a tape-measure or a piece of ordinary tape or a long strip of manila
paper and measure around the bottom of the boat at its widest
part in the middle from one gunwale (top of side) to the other, and
see that your cloth is fully as wide as your measurement. Fold
the canvas lengthwise so as to find its exact centre and crease it.
With two or three tacks fasten the cloth at its centre line (the
crease) to the stem-piece of the canoe. Stretch the canvas the
length of the boat with the crease of centre-line along the centre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
of the keel; pull it as taut as may be and again tack the centre
line to the stem at this end of the craft. If this has been done
carefully the cloth will hang an equal length over each side of the
canoe. Now begin amidships and drive tacks about two inches
apart along the gunwale, say an inch below the top surface.
After having tacked it for about two feet, go to the other side of
the boat, pull the cloth taut and in the same manner tack about
three feet. Continue this process first one side and then the other
until finished. While stretching the cloth knead it with the hand
and fingers so as to thicken or "full" it where it would otherwise
wrinkle; by doing this carefully it is possible to stretch the canvas
over the frame without the necessity of cutting it. The
cloth that extends beyond the frame may be brought over the
gunwale and tacked along the inside. Use four-ounce tinned
or copper tacks. The canvas is now stretched on every part
except on the high, rolling bow and stern. With a pair of shears
slit the canvas from the outer edge of the bow and stern within a
half inch of the ends of the keel.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><a id="Fig_63"></a><a id="Fig_64"></a>

<div class="caption">High bows framework made of packing-box and barrel-heads.</div>
</div>


<p>Fold the right-hand flap thus made at the left-hand end around<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
the bow and stern and, drawing tight, tack it down, then fold the
left-hand flap over the right-hand side and tack it in a similar
manner, trimming off the remaining cloth neatly. The five
braces, three of which are shown in <a href="#Fig_55">Fig. 55</a>, may be nailed to the
gunwales of the canoe, as the temporary moulds are removed.
The braces should be so notched that the top ends of the braces
will fit over the top edge of the gunwale and their lower edges
will fit against the sides. Give the boat at least three good coats
of paint and nail the two extra gunwale strips on the outside of
the canvas for guards.</p>

<p>When it is dry and the boat is launched you may startle the
onlookers and make the echoes ring with:</p>

<p>"Wo-ach! wo-ach! Ha-ha-ha-hack&mdash;wo-ach!" which is said
to be the identical war cry with which the Indians greeted the
landing of our Pilgrim Fathers.</p>

<p>The reader must not suppose that barrel-hoops are the best
material for ribs; they are but a makeshift, and although good-looking,
servicable canoes have been built of this material from
the foregoing descriptions, better ones may be made by using
better material, such, for instance, as is described in the making
of the birch-bark canoe.</p>


<h3>Old Shells</h3>

<p>Where there are oarsmen and boat-clubs, there you will find
beautiful shell boats of paper or cedar, shaped like darning-needles,
so slight in structure that a child can knock a hole in them,
and yet very seaworthy boats for those who understand how to
handle them. The expensive material and skilled labor necessary
to build a racing shell puts the price of one so high that few
boys can afford to buy one; but where new shells are to be found
there are also old ones, and when they are too old to sell they are
thrown away. Many an old shell rots on the meadows near the
boat-houses or rests among the rafters forgotten and unused,
which with a little work would make a boat capable of furnishing
no end of fun to a boy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>


<h3>Checks or Cracks</h3>

<div class='unindent'>can be pasted over with common manila wrapping-paper by
first covering the crack with a coat of paint, or, better still, of
varnish, then fitting the paper smoothly over the spot and varnishing
the paper. Give the paper several coats of varnish, allowing
it to dry after each application, and the paper will become
impervious to water. The deck of a shell is made of thin muslin
or paper, treated with a liberal coat of varnish, and can be patched
with similar material. There are always plenty of slightly damaged
oars which have been discarded by the oarsmen. The use
of a saw and jack-knife in the hands of a smart boy can transform
these wrecks into serviceable oars for his patched-up old
shell, and if the work is neatly done, the boy will be the proud
owner of a real shell boat, and the envy of his comrades.</div>


<h3>The Cause of Upsets</h3>

<p>A single shell that is very cranky with a man in it is comparatively
steady when a small boy occupies the seat. Put on your
bathing clothes when you wish to try a shell, so that you may be
ready for the inevitable upset. Every one knows, when he looks
at one of these long, narrow boats, that as long as the oars are
held extended <i>on the water</i> it cannot upset. But, in spite of that
knowledge, every one, when he first gets into a shell, endeavors
to balance himself by <i>lifting the oars</i>, and, of course, goes over in
a jiffy.</p>


<h3>The Delights of a Shell</h3>

<p>It is an error to suppose that the frail-looking, needle-like
boat is only fit for racing purposes. For a day on the water, in
calm weather, there is, perhaps, nothing more enjoyable than a
single shell. The exertion required to send it on its way is so
slight, and the speed so great, that many miles can be covered
with small fatigue. Upon referring to the log-book of the Nereus
Club, where the distances are all taken from the United States<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
chart, the author finds that twenty and thirty miles are not uncommon
records for single-shell rows.</p>

<p>During the fifteen or sixteen seasons that the author has devoted
his spare time to the sport he has often planned a heavy
cruising shell, but owing to the expense of having such a boat
built he has used the ordinary racing boat, and found it remarkably
well adapted for such purposes. Often he has been caught
miles away from home in a blow, and only once does he remember
of being compelled to seek assistance.</p>

<p>He was on a lee shore and the waves were so high that after
once being swamped he was unable to launch his boat again,
for it would fill before he could embark. So a heavy rowboat
and a coachman were borrowed from a gentleman living on the
bay, and while the author rowed, the coachman towed the little
craft back to the creek where the Nereus club-house is situated.</p>

<p>In the creek, however, the water was calmer, and rather than
stand the jeers of his comrades, the writer embarked in his shell
and rowed up to the boat-house float. He was very wet and his
boat was full of water, but to the inquiry of "Rough out in the
bay?" he confined himself to the simple answer&mdash;"Yes." Then
dumping the water from his shell and placing it upon the rack
he put on his dry clothes and walked home, none the worse for
the accident.</p>

<p>After ordinary skill and confidence are acquired it is really
astonishing what feats can be accomplished in a frail racing boat.</p>

<h3>Stand Upright In a Shell</h3>

<div class='unindent'>if you first take one of your long stockings and tie the handles
of your oars together where they cross each other in front of you.
The ends will work slightly and the blades will keep their positions
on the water, acting as two long balances. Now slide your seat
as far forward as it will go, slip your feet from the straps and grasp
the straps with your hand, moving the feet back to a comfortable
position. When all ready raise yourself by pulling on the foot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a><br /><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
strap, and with ordinary care you can stand upright in the needle-shaped
boat, an apparently impossible thing to do when you look
at the narrow craft.</div>


<h3>How to Land Where There Is No Float</h3>

<p>When for any reason you wish to land where there is no float,
row into shallow water and put one foot overboard until it touches
bottom. Then follow with the other foot, rise, and you are standing
astride of your boat.</p>


<h3>How to Embark Where There Is No Float</h3>

<p>Wade out and slide the shell between your extended legs until
the seat is underneath you. Sit down, and, with the feet still
in the water, grasp your oars. With these in your hands it is
an easy task to balance the boat until you can lift your feet into it.</p>


<h3>Ozias Dodge's Umbrella Canoe</h3>

<p>Mr. Dodge is a Yale man, an artist, and an enthusiastic canoeist.
The prow of his little craft has ploughed its way through the
waters of many picturesque streams in this country and Europe,
by the river-side, under the walls of ruined castles, where the
iron-clad warriors once built their camp-fires, and near pretty
villages, where people dress as if they were at a fancy-dress ball.</p>

<p>When a young man like Mr. Dodge says that he has built a
folding canoe that is not hard to construct, is inexpensive and
practical, there can be little doubt that such a boat is not only
what is claimed for it by its inventor, but that it is a novelty in its
line, and such is undoubtedly the case with the umbrella canoe.</p>


<h3>How the Canoe Was Built</h3>

<p>The artist first secured a white-ash plank (A, <a href="#Fig_65">Fig. 65</a>), free
from knots and blemishes of all kinds. The plank was one inch
thick and about twelve feet long. At the mill he had this sawed
into eight strips one inch wide, one inch thick, and twelve feet
long (B and C, <a href="#Fig_66">Figs. 66</a> and <a href="#Fig_67">67</a>). Then he planed off the square<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
edges of each stick until they were all octagonal in form, and
looked like so many great lead-pencils (D, <a href="#Fig_68">Fig. 68</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><a id="Fig_76"></a>
<img src="images/i_058a.png" width="600" height="110" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 76.&mdash;Frame of umbrella canoe.</div>
</div>

<p>Mr. Dodge claims that, after you have reduced the ash poles
to this octagonal form, it is an easy matter to whittle them with
your pocket-knife or a draw-knife, and by taking off all the angles
of the sticks make them cylindrical in form (E, <a href="#Fig_69">Fig. 69</a>); then
smooth them off nicely with sand-paper, so that each pole has a
smooth surface and is three-quarters of an inch in diameter.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><a id="Fig_77"></a>
<img src="images/i_058b.png" width="600" height="107" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 77.&mdash;Umbrella canoe.</div>
</div>

<p>After the poles were reduced to this state he whittled all the
ends to the form of a truncated cone&mdash;that is, like a sharpened
lead-pencil with the lead broken off (F, <a href="#Fig_70">Fig. 70</a>)&mdash;a blunt point.
He next went to a tinsmith and had two sheet-iron cups made
large enough to cover the eight pole-ends (G and G´, <a href="#Fig_71">Figs. 71</a>
and <a href="#Fig_72">72</a>). Each cup was six inches deep. After trying the cups,
or thimbles, on the poles to see that they would fit, he made two
moulds of oak. First he cut two pieces of oak plank two feet six
inches long by one foot six inches (H, <a href="#Fig_74">Fig. 74</a>), which he trimmed
into the form shown by J, <a href="#Fig_75">Fig. 75</a>, making a notch to fit each of
the round ribs, and to spread them as the ribs of an umbrella are
spread. He made two other similar moulds for the bow and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
stern, each of which, of course, is smaller than the middle one.
After spreading the ribs with the moulds, and bringing the ends
together in the tin cups, he made holes in the bottom of the cups
where the ends of the ribs came, and fastened the ribs to the cups
with brass screws, fitted with leather washers, and run through
the holes in the tin and screwed into the ends of the poles or ribs.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><a id="Fig_78"></a>
<img src="images/i_059.png" width="600" height="227" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 78.&mdash;Canoe folded for transportation. Canoe in water in distance.</div>
</div>

<p>A square hole was then cut through each mould (K, <a href="#Fig_75">Fig. 75</a>),
and the poles put in place, gathered together at the ends, and held
in place by the tin thimbles. The square holes in the moulds
allow several small, light floor planks to form a dry floor to the
canoe.</p>

<p>The canvas costs about forty-five cents a yard, and five yards
are all you need. The deck can be made of drilling, which comes
about twenty-eight inches wide and costs about twenty cents a
yard. Five yards of this will be plenty. Fit your canvas over
the frame, stretch it tightly, and tack it securely to the two top
ribs only. Fasten the deck on in the same manner.</p>

<p>When Mr. Dodge had the canoe covered and decked, with a
square hole amidship to sit in, he put two good coats of paint on
the canvas, allowed it to dry, and his boat was ready for use
(<a href="#Fig_77">Fig. 77</a>). He quaintly says that "it looked like a starved dog,
with all its ribs showing through the skin," just as the ribs of an
umbrella show on top through the silk covering. But this does<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
not in any way impede the progress of the boat through the
water.</p>

<p>Where the moulds are the case is different, for the lines of the
moulds cross the line of progress at right angles and must necessarily
somewhat retard the boat. But even this is not perceptible.
The worst feature about the moulds is that the canvas is very apt
to be damaged there by contact with the shore, float, or whatever
object it rubs against.</p>

<p>With ordinary care the umbrella canoe</p>


<h3>Will Last for Years</h3>

<div class='unindent'>and is a good boat for paddling on inland streams and small
bodies of water; and when you are through with it for the night,
all that is necessary is to remove the stretchers by springing the
poles from the notches in the spreaders, roll up the canvas around
the poles, put it on your shoulder, and carry it home or to camp,
as shown in <a href="#Fig_78">Fig. 78</a>.</div>

<p>To put your canoe together again put in the moulds, fit the
poles in their places, and the umbrella is raised, or, rather, the
canoe is, if we can use such an expression in regard to a boat.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI<br />
<small>THE BIRCH-BARK</small></h2>

<div class='summary1'>How to Build a Real Birch-Bark Canoe or a Canvas Canoe on
a "Birch-Bark" Frame&mdash;How to Mend a Birch-Bark</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Although</span> the Indian was the first to build these simple little
boats, some of his white brothers are quite as expert in the work.
But the red man can outdo his white brother in navigating the
craft. The only tools required in building a canoe are a knife
and awl, a draw-shave and a hammer. An Indian can do all of
his work with a knife.</p>

<p>Several years ago canvas began to be used extensively in canoe-building,
instead of birch bark, and it will eventually entirely
supersede birch, although nothing can be found that bends so
gracefully. There are several canvas-canoe factories in Maine,
and the canoes made of canvas have both the symmetry and the
durability of the birches. They are also a trifle cheaper, but if
the real thing and sentiment are wanted, one should never have
anything but a bark craft.</p>

<p>If properly handled, a good canoe will safely hold four men.
Canoes intended for deep water should have considerable depth.
Those intended for shoal water, such as trout-fishers use, are made
as flat as possible. Up to the time when canoeing was introduced
the materials for building craft of this kind could be found all
along the rivers. Big birch-trees grew in countless numbers, and
clear, straight cedar was quite as plentiful within a few feet of the
water's edge. Now one must go miles back into the dense forests
for such materials, and even then seldom does it happen that two
suitable trees are found within sight of one or the other. Cedar
is more difficult of the two to find.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>


<h3>The Tree</h3>

<p>The tree is selected, first, for straightness; second, smoothness;
third, freedom from knots or limbs; fourth, toughness of bark;
fifth, small size of eyes; sixth, length (the last is not so important,
as two trees can be put together), and, seventh, size (which is
also not so important, as the sides can be pieced out).</p>


<h3>Dimensions</h3>

<p>The average length of canoe is about 19 feet over all, running,
generally, from 18 to 22 feet for a boat to be used on inland waters,
the sea-going canoes being larger, with relatively higher bows.
The average width is about 30 inches inside, measured along the
middle cross-bar; the greatest width inside is several inches below
the middle cross-bar, and is several inches greater than the width
measured along said cross-bar.</p>

<p>The measurements given below are those of a canoe 19 feet
over all: 16 feet long inside, measured along the curve of the gunwale;
30 inches wide inside. The actual length inside is less
than 16 feet, but the measurement along the gunwales is the most
important.</p>


<h3>Bark</h3>

<p>Bark can be peeled when the sap is flowing or when the tree
is not frozen&mdash;at any time in late spring, summer, and early fall
(called summer bark); in winter during a thaw, when the tree
is not frozen, and when the sap may have begun to flow.</p>


<h3>Difference in the Bark</h3>

<p>Summer bark peels readily, is smooth inside, of a yellow color,
which turns reddish upon exposure to the sun, and is chalky-gray
in very old canoes. Winter bark adheres closely, and forcibly
brings up part of the inner bark, which on exposure turns
dark red. This rough surface may be moistened and scraped
away. All winter-bark canoes must be thus scraped and made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
smooth. Sometimes the dark red is left in the form of a decorative
pattern extending around the upper edge of the canoe, the
rest of the surface being scraped smooth.</p>


<h3>Process of Peeling</h3>

<p>The tree should be cut down so that the bark can be removed
more easily.</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><a id="Fig_79"></a>
<img src="images/i_063a.png" width="600" height="144" alt="Drawing" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 79.&mdash;Showing how the butt is kept off the ground.</div>
</div>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 233px;"><a id="Fig_80"></a>
<img src="images/i_063b.png" width="233" height="136" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 80.</div>
</div>

<div class="figright" style="width: 128px;"><a id="Fig_81"></a>
<img src="images/i_063c.png" width="128" height="279" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 81.</div>
</div>

<p>A log called a skid (<a href="#Fig_79">Fig. 79</a>) is laid on the ground a few feet
from the base of the tree, which will keep the butt of the tree
off the ground when the tree is felled. The limbs at the top will
keep the other end off the ground. A space is cleared of bushes
and obstructions where the tree is to fall.</p>


<p>After the tree has been cut down, a cut is made in a straight
line (A, B, <a href="#Fig_79">Fig. 79</a>), splitting the bark from top to bottom, and
a ring cut at A and B (<a href="#Fig_79">Fig. 79</a>). When sap is flowing, the bark
is readily removed; but in winter the edges of the cut are raised
with a knife, and a thin, pliant hard-wood knife or "spud" is
pushed around under the bark.</p>


<h3>Toasting</h3>

<p>After the bark has dropped upon the ground the inside surface
is warmed with a torch, which softens and straightens it out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
flat. The torch is made of a bundle of birch bark held in a
split stick (<a href="#Fig_81">Fig. 81</a>).</p>

<p>It is then rolled up like a carpet, with inside surface out, and
tightly bound, generally with cedar bark when the latter can be
procured (<a href="#Fig_80">Fig. 80</a>).</p>

<p>If the tree is long enough, a piece is taken off at least nineteen
feet in length, so that the ends of the canoe may not be pieced
out. A few shorter pieces are
wrapped up with the bundle
for piecing out the sides.</p>


<h3>The Roll</h3>

<div class='unindent'>is taken on the back in an
upright position, and is carried
by a broad band of cedar
bark, passing under the lower
end of the roll and around in
front of the breast and shoulders
(<a href="#Fig_82">Fig. 82</a>).</div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 281px;"><a id="Fig_82"></a>
<img src="images/i_064.png" width="281" height="401" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 82.&mdash;Mode of carrying roll.</div>
</div>


<h3>Effects of Heat</h3>

<p>It is laid where the sun will
not shine on it and harden it.
The first effect of heat is to make it pliant. Long exposure to
heat or to dry atmosphere makes it hard and brittle.</p>


<h3>The Woodwork</h3>

<div class='unindent'>is as follows:</div>

<p>Five cross-bars of rock-maple (<a href="#Fig_83">Figs. 83</a>, <a href="#Fig_85">85</a>, and <a href="#Fig_91">91</a>). All the
rest is of white cedar, taken from the heart. The sap-wood
absorbs water, and would make the canoe too heavy, so it is rejected.
The wood requires to be straight and clear, and it is
best to use perfectly green wood for the ribs.</p>

<p>Two strips 16½ feet long, 1½ inch square, tapering toward either<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
end, the ends being notched (<a href="#Fig_83">Fig. 83</a> A) is a section of the 16½
foot strip. Each strip is mortised for the cross-bars (see <a href="#Fig_85">Fig. 85</a>).
The lower outside edge is bevelled off to receive the ends of the
ribs.</p>

<p>The dimensions of the cross-bars (<a href="#Fig_85">Fig. 85</a>) are 12 x 2 x ½ inch,
22½ x 2 x ¾ inch, and 30 x 2 x <small><sup>7</sup>/<sub>8</sub></small> inch. The cross-bars are placed
in position, and the ends of the gunwales are tied with spruce
roots after being nailed together to prevent splitting. Each
bar is held in place by a peg of hard wood.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><a id="Fig_83"></a><a id="Fig_83_5"></a>
<img src="images/i_065.png" width="600" height="213" alt="drawing" />

larger version of this image, click <a href="images/i_065-big.png">here</a>.</div></div>

<p>For stitching and wrapping, long, slender roots of spruce, or
sometimes of elm, are peeled and split in two. Black ash splits
are rarely used except for repairing (<a href="#Fig_86">Figs. 86</a>, <a href="#Fig_87">87</a>, <a href="#Fig_88">88</a>).</p>

<p>Next we need (B, <a href="#Fig_83">Fig. 83</a>) two strips 1 or 1¼ inch by ½ inch, a
little over 19 feet long, to go outside of gunwales, and (C, <a href="#Fig_83">Fig.
83</a>) two top strips, same length, 2 inches wide in middle, tapering
to 1 inch at either end, 1½ inch thick.</p>

<div class='tnote'><div class='center'>[Transcriber's Note: To see a larger version of this

<h3>Ribs</h3>

<p>About fifty in number (<a href="#Fig_91">Figs. 91</a>, <a href="#Fig_92">92</a>) are split with the grain
(F, <a href="#Fig_92">Fig. 92</a>), so that the heart side of the wood will be on the inner
side when the rib is bent. The wood bends better this way.
They must be perfectly straight-grained and free from knots.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
Ribs for the middle are four inches wide, ribs for the ends about
three inches wide (<a href="#Fig_91">Fig. 91</a> and G, <a href="#Fig_92">Fig. 92</a>), and are whittled down
to a scant half an inch (<a href="#Fig_93">Fig. 93</a>). Green wood is generally used,
and before it has had any time to season. The ribs may be softened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
by pouring hot water on them, and should be bent in pairs
to prevent breaking (<a href="#Fig_90">Fig. 90</a>). They are held in shape by a band
of cedar bark passed around outside.</p>

<p>The ribs are of importance in the shaping of the canoe. The
sides bulge out (<a href="#Fig_91">Figs. 91</a>, <a href="#Fig_92">92</a>).
The shape of the ribs determines
the depth and stability of the
canoe.</p>


<h3>Lining Strips</h3>

<p>Other strips, an eighth of an
inch thick, are carefully whittled
out, with straight edges. They
are a little over eight feet long,
and are designed to be laid inside
on the bark, edge to edge,
between the bark and the ribs.
These strips lap an inch or two
where they meet, in the middle
of the canoe, and are wider here
than at the ends, owing to the
greater circumference of the canoe
in the middle.</p>


<h3>Seasoning</h3>

<p>All the timber is carefully tied
up before building and laid
away. The ribs are allowed to
season perfectly, so that they will keep their shape and not
spring back.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 93.<br />Details of ribs, Indian knives and method of

</div>




<h3>The Bed</h3>

<p>Next the bed is prepared on a level spot, if possible shaded
from the sun. A space is levelled about three and a half feet
wide and a little longer than the canoe. The surface is made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
perfectly smooth. The middle is one or two inches higher than
either end.</p>


<h3>Building</h3>

<p>The frame is laid exactly in the middle of the bed. A small
post is driven in the ground (<a href="#Fig_94">Fig. 94</a>), on which each end of the
frame will rest. Stakes, two or three feet long and about two
inches in diameter, are whittled flat on one side, and are driven
with the flat side toward the frame at the following points, leaving
a space of about a quarter of an inch between the stake and
the frame (<a href="#Fig_94">Fig. 94</a>): One stake an inch or two on either side of
each cross-bar, and another stake half way between each cross-bar.
This makes eleven stakes on each side of the frame.
Twelve additional stakes are driven as follows: One pair facing
each other, at the end of the frame; another pair, an inch apart,
about six inches from the last pair, measuring toward the ends
of the canoe; and another pair, an inch apart, a foot from these.
These last stakes will be nine and a half feet from the middle of
the frame, and nineteen feet from the corresponding stakes at
the other end. Next, these stakes are all taken up, and the
frame laid aside.</p>

<div class='tnote'><div class='center'>[Transcriber's Note: To see a larger version of this
image, click <a href="images/i_068x.png">here</a>.]</div></div>


<h3>To Soften the Bark</h3>

<p>Next the bark is unrolled. If it has laid until it has become
a little hardened, it is placed in the river or stream for a day or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
two. It is spread out flat, and laid upon the bed with the gray
or outside surface up. The inside surface is placed downward,
and becomes the outside of the canoe.</p>

<p>The frame is replaced upon the bark, so that it will be at the
same distance from each side and end of the bed that it was before.
At each cross-bar boards are laid across the frame, and
heavy stones are laid upon them to keep the frame solid and immovable
upon the bark (<a href="#Fig_85">Fig. 85</a>, C). The edges of the bark are
next bent up in a perpendicular position, and in order that it
may bend smoothly slits are made in the bark in an outward direction,
at right angles to the frame. A cut is made close to the
end of each cross-bar, and one half way between each bar,
which is generally sufficient to allow the bark to be bent up
smoothly. As the bark is bent up, the large stakes are slipped
back in the holes which they occupied before, and the tops of
each opposite pair are connected with a strip of cedar bark which
keeps the stakes perfectly perpendicular. At each end it is
necessary to take out a small triangular piece or gore, so that the
edges may come together without overlapping.</p>

<p>Next twenty-two pieces of cedar, one to two feet long, and
about ½ or ¾ inch thick, are split out, and whittled thin and flat
at one end. This sharpened edge is inserted between the outside
edge of the frame and the bent-up bark, opposite each large
stake. The other end of the chisel-shaped piece is tightly tied
to the large stake outside. By means of the <i>large outside stake</i>
and the inside "<i>stake</i>," so-called, the bark is held in a perfectly
upright position; and in order to keep the bent-up part more
perfectly flat and smooth, the strips of cedar are pushed in lengthwise
between the stakes and the bark, on each side of the bark,
as shown in sectional views (<a href="#Fig_85">Fig. 85</a>, C, D).</p>

<p>Sometimes, in place of having temporary strips to go on outside
of the bark, the long outside strip (B, <a href="#Fig_83">Fig. 83</a>), is slipped
in place instead.</p>

<p>It may now be seen if the bark is not wide enough. If it is
not, the sides must be pieced out with a narrow piece, cut in such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
a way that the eyes in the bark will run in the same direction as
those of the large piece.</p>

<p>As a general rule, from the middle to the next bar the strip
for piecing is placed on the inside of the large piece, whose upper
edge has previously been trimmed straight, and the two are sewed
together by the stitch shown in <a href="#Fig_86">Fig. 86</a>, the spruce root being
passed over another root laid along the trimmed-off edge of the
large piece of bark to prevent the stitches from tearing out.
From the second bar to the end of the canoe, or as far as may be
necessary, the strip is placed outside the large piece, and from the
second to the end bar is sewed as in <a href="#Fig_87">Fig. 87</a>, and from the end
bar to the end of the canoe is stitched as in <a href="#Fig_88">Fig. 88</a>.</p>

<p>Next, the weights are taken off the frame, which is raised up as
follows, the bark remaining flat on the bed as before:</p>

<p>A post eight inches long is set up under each end of middle
cross-bar (<a href="#Fig_85">Fig. 85</a>, D), one end resting on the bark and the other
end supporting either end of the middle cross-bar. Another
post, nine inches long, is similarly placed under each end of the
next cross-bar. Another, twelve inches long, is placed under
each end of the end cross-bar; and another, sixteen and a half or
seventeen inches, supports each end of the frame.</p>

<p>As the posts are placed under each cross-bar, the weights are
replaced; and as these posts are higher at the ends than in the
middle, the proper curve is obtained for the gunwales. The
temporary strips, that have been placed outside the bent-up
portion of the bark, are removed, and the long outside strip before
mentioned (B, <a href="#Fig_83">Fig. 83</a>) is slipped in place between the outside
stakes and the bark. This strip is next nailed to the frame
with wrought-iron nails that pass through the bark and are
clinched on the inside. This outside strip has taken exactly the
curve of the frame, but its upper edge, before nailing, was raised
so as to be out an eighth of an inch (or the thickness of the bark)
higher than the top surface of the frame, so that when the edges
of the bark have been bent down, and tacked flat to the frame,
a level surface will be presented, upon which the wide top strip<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
will eventually be nailed. Formerly the outer strip was bound to
the frame with roots every few inches, but now it is nailed.</p>

<p>The cross-bars are now lashed to the frame, having previously
been held only by a peg. The roots are passed through holes
in the end of the bars, around the outside strip (see right-hand side
of <a href="#Fig_85">Fig. 85</a>). A two-inch piece of the bark, which has been tacked
down upon the frame, is removed at the ends by the cross-bars,
where the spruce roots are to pass around, and the outside strip
is cut away to a corresponding extent, so that the roots, when
wrapped around, will be flush with the surface above.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><a id="Fig_95"></a>
<img src="images/i_071.png" width="600" height="130" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 95.&mdash;Shows how to describe arc of circle for bow, also ornamentation of winter bark.</div>
</div>
<div class='tnote'><div class='center'>[Transcriber's Note: To see a larger version of this
image, click <a href="images/i_071-big.png">here</a>.]</div></div>

<p>All the stakes are now removed, and laid away to be ready
for the next canoe that may be built, and the canoe taken upside
down upon two horses or benches, that will keep the craft clear
of the ground.</p>

<p>The shape of the bow is now marked out, either by the eye or
with mechanical aid, according to the following rule: An arc of
a circle, with a radius of seventeen inches, is described (<a href="#Fig_95">Fig. 95</a>)
having as a centre a point shown in diagram. The bark is then
cut away to this line.</p>


<h3>Bow-piece</h3>

<p>To stiffen the bow, a bow-piece of cedar, nearly three feet long
(<a href="#Fig_96">Fig. 96</a>), an inch and a half wide, and half an inch thick on one
edge, bevelled and rounded off toward the other edge, is needed.
To facilitate bending edgeways it is split into four or five sections
(as in <a href="#Fig_98">Fig. 98</a>) for about thirty inches. The end that remains
unsplit is notched on its thicker edge (<a href="#Fig_96">Fig. 96</a>) to receive the lower
end of an oval cedar board (<a href="#Fig_97">Fig. 97</a>) that is placed upright in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
bow underneath the tip of the frame. It is bent to correspond
with the curve of the boat, with the thin edge toward the outside
of the circle, and wrapped with twine, so that it will keep its shape.
The bow-piece is placed between the edges of the bark, which are
then sewed together by an
over-and-over stitch, which
passes through the bow-piece.</p>

<p>A pitch is prepared of
rosin and grease, in such
proportions that it will
neither readily crack in
cold water nor melt in the
sun. One or the other ingredient
is added until by
test it is found just right.</p>


<h3>Patching and Pitching</h3>

<p>The canoe is now placed
on the ground, right side up,
and all holes are covered
on the inside with thin
birch bark that is pasted down with hot pitch. A strip of cloth
is saturated with hot pitch, and pressed into the cracks on either
side of the bow-piece inside, between the bark and the bow-piece
(<a href="#Fig_99">Fig. 99</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 590px;"><a id="Fig_96"></a><a id="Fig_97"></a><a id="Fig_98"></a><a id="Fig_99"></a><a id="Fig_100"></a>
<img src="images/i_072.png" width="590" height="653" alt="drawings" />
<div class="caption">Figs. 97-100.&mdash;Show details of canoe bow.</div>
</div>

<p>The thin longitudinal strips are next laid in position, edge to
edge, lapping several inches by the middle; they are whittled
thin here so as to lap evenly.</p>

<p>The ribs are next tightly driven in place, commencing at the
small end ones and working toward the middle. The end ribs
may be two or three inches apart, being closer toward the middle,
where, in many cases, they touch. Usually, they are about half
an inch apart in the middle. Each rib is driven into place with
a square-ended stick and a mallet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>The ends are stuffed with shavings (<a href="#Fig_100">Fig. 100</a> and "Section"
<a href="#Fig_100_5">Fig. 100½</a>), and an oval cedar board is put in the place formerly
occupied by the post that supported the end of the frame. The
lower end rests in the notch of the bow-piece, while the upper is
cut with two shoulders that fit underneath each side of the frame;
<a href="#Fig_97">Fig. 97</a> shows the cedar board.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 444px;"><a id="Fig_100_5"></a>

<img src="images/i_073b.png" width="636" height="284" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 101.<br />Canoe paddles.</div>
</div>

<p>The top strip is next nailed on to the frame. Almost always a
piece of bark, a foot or more long, and nine or ten inches wide,
is bent and slipped under, between
both top and side strips
and the bark. The ends of this
piece hang down about three
inches below the side strips.
The loose ends of the strips are
bound together, as in diagram,
and the projecting tips of both
strips and bow-piece are trimmed
off close.</p>

<p>Next the canoe is turned upside
down. If winter bark has
been used, the surface is moistened
and the roughness scraped
off with a knife. Generally the
red rough surface is left in the form of a decorative pattern
several inches wide around the upper edge (<a href="#Fig_95">Fig. 95</a>). Sometimes
the maker's name and date are left in this way.</p>

<p>Finally, a strip of stout canvas, three or four inches wide, is
dipped in the melted pitch and laid on the stitching at the ends,
extending up sufficiently far above the water-line. All cracks and
seams are covered with pitch, laid on with a small wooden paddle.
While still soft, a wet finger or the palm of the hand is
rubbed over the pitch to smooth it down before it hardens.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>


<h3>Leaks</h3>

<p>Water is placed inside, and the leaky places marked, to be
stopped when dry. A can of rosin is usually carried in the canoe,
and when a leak occurs, the canoe is taken out of the water, the
leak discovered by sucking, the place dried with a torch of wood
or birch bark, and the pitch applied.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><a id="Fig_101_5"></a>
<img src="images/i_074.png" width="600" height="350" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 101½.&mdash;From photograph of Indian building a birch-bark canoe.</div>
</div>

<p>Paddles are made of rock maple, and sometimes of birch and
even cedar. Bow paddles are usually longer and narrower in
the blade than stern paddles (<a href="#Fig_101">Fig. 101</a>).</p>


<h3>Bottom Protection</h3>

<p>Sometimes the canoe is shod with "shoes," or strips of cedar,
laid lengthwise and tied to the outside of the bark with ash splits
that pass through holes in the cedar shoes, and are brought up
around the sides of the canoe and tied to each cross-bar. This
protects the bottom of the boat from the sharp rocks that abound
in some rapid streams.</p>

<p>All canoes are of the general shape of the one described,
though this is considerably varied in different localities, some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
being built with high rolling bows, some slender, some wider,
some nearly straight on the bottom, others decidedly curved.</p>

<p>Besides the two paddles the canoe should carry a pole ten feet
long, made of a slender spruce, whittled so as to be about one
and three-fourths inch in diameter in the middle and smaller
at either end, and having at one end either a ring and a spike or
else a pointed cap of iron. The pole is used for propelling the
canoe up swift streams. This, says Tappan Adney, "is absolutely
indispensable." The person using the pole stands in one
end, or nearer the middle if alone, and pushes the canoe along
close to the bank, so as to take advantage of the eddies, guiding
the canoe with one motion, only to be learned by practice, and
keeping the pole usually on the side next the bank. Where the
streams have rocky and pebbly bottoms poling is easy, but in
muddy or soft bottoms it is tiresome work; muddy bottoms, however,
are not usually found in rapid waters.</p>


<h3>A Canvas Canoe</h3>

<div class='unindent'>can be made by substituting canvas in the place of birch bark;
and if it is kept well painted it makes not only a durable but a
very beautiful boat. The writer once owned a canvas canoe
that was at least fifteen years old and still in good condition.</div>

<p>About six yards of ten-ounce cotton canvas, fifty inches wide,
will be sufficient to cover a canoe, and it will require two papers
of four-ounce copper tacks to secure the canvas on the frame.</p>

<p>The boat should be placed, deck down, upon two "horses" or
wooden supports, such as you see carpenters and builders use.</p>

<p>Fold the canvas lengthwise, so as to find the centre, then tack
the centre of one end of the cloth to top of bow-piece, or stem,
using two or three tacks to hold it securely. Stretch the cloth
the length of the boat, pull it taut, with the centre line of the canvas
over the keel line of the canoe, and tack the centre of the other
end of the cloth to the top of the stern-piece.</p>

<p>If care has been taken thus far, an equal portion of the covering
will lap the gunwale on each side of the boat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>Begin amidships and drive the tacks, about two inches apart,
along the gunwale and an inch below the deck (on the outside).
Tack about two feet on one side, pull the cloth tightly across,
and tack it about three feet on the other side. Continue to alternate,
tacking on one side and then the other, until finished.</p>

<p>With the hands and fingers knead the cloth so as to thicken
or "full" it where it would otherwise wrinkle, and it will be possible
to stretch the canvas without cutting it over the frame.</p>

<p>The cloth that projects beyond the gunwale may be used for
the deck, or it may be cut off after bringing it over and tacking
upon the inside of the gunwale, leaving the canoe open like a
birch-bark.</p>


<h3>To Paddle a Canoe</h3>

<p>No one can expect to learn to paddle a canoe from a book, however
explicit the directions may be. There is only one way to
learn to swim and that is by going into the water and trying it,
and the only proper way to learn to paddle a canoe is to paddle
one until you catch the knack.</p>

<p>In the ordinary canoe, to be found at the summer watering
places, there are cane seats and they are always too high for safety.
A top load on any sort of a boat is always dangerous, and every
real canoeist seats his passengers on the bottom of the boat and
kneels on the bottom himself while paddling. Of course, one's
knees will feel more comfortable if there is some sort of a cushion
under them, and a passenger will be less liable to get wet if he
has a pneumatic cushion on which to sit. No expert canoeist
paddles alternately first on the one side, and then on the other;
on the contrary, he takes pride in his ability to keep his paddle
continuously on either side that suits his convenience.</p>

<p>The Indians of the North Woods are probably the best paddlers,
and from them we can take points in the art. It is from them
we first learned the use of the canoe, for our open canvas canoes
of to-day are practically modelled on the lines of the old birch-barks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>When you are standing upright and your paddle is in front of
you with the blade upon the ground, the handle should reach to
your eye-brows. (See Figs. <a href="#Fig_101">101</a>, <a href="#Fig_102">102</a>, <a href="#Fig_103">103</a>, etc.)</p>

<p>Kneel with the paddle across the canoe and not farther forward
than the knees. Then dip the blade <i>edgewise</i> (not point first) by
raising the upper hand without bending the elbow. Swing the
paddle back, keeping it close to the canoe, and give a little twist
to the upper wrist to set the paddle at the proper angle shown in
the photos. The exact angle depends upon the trim of the boat,
the wind, etc., and must be such that the canoe does not swerve
<i>at any part</i> of the stroke, but travels straight ahead. The lower
arm acts mainly as a fulcrum and does not move back and forth
more than a foot. The power comes from the upper arm and
shoulder, and the body bends forward as the weight is thrown on
the paddle. The stroke continues until the paddle slides out of
the water endwise, flat on the surface. Then for recovery the
blade is brought forward by a swing from the shoulder, <i>not</i> lifting it
vertically, but swinging it horizontally with the blade parallel to
the water and the upper hand low. When it reaches a point
opposite the knee it is slid into the water again, edgewise, for another
stroke. The motion is a more or less rotary one, like stirring
cake, not a simple movement back and forth.</p>


<h3>To Carry a Canoe</h3>

<p>To pick up a canoe and carry it requires not only the knack but
also muscle, and no undeveloped boy should make the attempt,
as he might strain himself, with serious results. But there are
plenty of young men&mdash;good, husky fellows&mdash;who can learn to do
this without any danger of injury if they are taught <i>how</i> to lift
by a competent physical instructor.</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><a id="Fig_105"></a><a id="Fig_106"></a><a id="Fig_107"></a><a id="Fig_108"></a><a id="Fig_109"></a>

</div>
<p>To pick up a canoe for a "carry," stoop over and grasp the
middle brace with the right arm extended, and a short hold with
the left hand, as shown in <a href="#Fig_105">Fig. 105</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>When you have a secure hold, hoist the canoe up on your legs,
as shown in <a href="#Fig_106">Fig. 106</a>. Without stopping the motion give her
another boost, until you have the canoe with the upper side above
your head, as in <a href="#Fig_107">Fig. 107</a>. In the diagram the paddles are not
spread apart as far as they should be. If the paddles are too
close together a fall may break ones neck.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 110.&mdash;Northern Quebec Indians crossing the "ladder portage."</div>
</div>

<p>Now turn the canoe over your head and slide your head between
the paddles (which are lashed to the spreaders, as shown in
<a href="#Fig_105">Fig. 105</a>), and twist your body around as you let the canoe
settle down over your head (<a href="#Fig_108">Fig. 108</a>). If you have a sweater or a
coat, it will help your shoulders by making a roll of it to serve as
a pad under the paddles, as in <a href="#Fig_109">Fig. 109</a>. I have seen an Indian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
carry a canoe in this manner on a dog-trot over a five-mile portage
without resting. I also have seen Indians carry canoes over mountains,
crossing by the celebrated Ladder Portage in western
Quebec, where the only means of scaling a cliff is by ascending
a ladder made of notched logs. For real canoe work it is
necessary that a man should know how to carry his craft across<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
country from one body of water to another. All through the
Lakelands of Canada, and also the Lake St. John district, up
to Hudson Bay itself, the only trails are by water, with portage
across from one stream or lake to the other.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII<br />
<small>HOW TO BUILD A PADDLING DORY</small></h2>

<div class='summary2'>A Simple Boat Which Any One Can Build&mdash;The Cheapest Sort
of a Boat</div>


<p><span class="smcap">To</span> construct this craft it is, of course, necessary that we shall
have some lumber, but we will use the smallest amount and the
expense will come within the limits of a small purse.</p>

<p>First we must have two boards, their lengths depending upon
circumstances and the lumber available. The ones in the
diagram are supposed to be of pine to measure (after being
trimmed) 18 feet long by 18 inches wide and about 1 inch thick.
When the boards are trimmed down so as to be exact duplicates
of each other, place one board over the other so that their edges
all fit exactly and then nail each end of the two boards together
for the distance of about six inches. Turn the boards over and
nail them upon the opposite side in the same manner, clamping
the nail ends if they protrude. Do this by holding the head of a
hammer or a stone against the heads of the nails while you
hold a wire nail against the protruding end, and with a hammer
bend it over the nail until it can be mashed flat against the board
so that it will not project beyond its surface.</p>

<p>After you have proceeded thus far, take some pieces of tin (<a href="#Fig_112">Fig.
112</a>) and bend the ragged edges over, so as to make a clean,
straight fold, and hammer it down flat until there are no rough or
raw edges exposed. Now tack a piece of this tin over the end of
the boards which composed the sides of the boat, as in <a href="#Fig_114">Fig. 114</a>.
Make the holes for the tacks first by driving the pointed end of a
wire nail through the tin where you wish the tacks to go and
then tack the tin snugly and neatly on, after which tack on
another piece of tin on both bow and stern, as in <a href="#Fig_116">Fig. 116</a>. This
will hold the two ends of the boards securely together so that they
may be carefully sprung apart in the middle to receive the middle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
mould which is to hold them in shape until the bottom of the boat
is nailed on, and the permanent thwarts, or seats, fastened inside.
When the latter are permanently fixed they will keep the boat in
shape.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 622px;"><a id="Fig_111"></a>
<img src="images/i_083a.png" width="622" height="126" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 111.&mdash;Parts of dory.</div>
</div>

<p>To make the mould, which is only a temporary thing, you
may use any rough board, or boards nailed together with cleats
to hold them. The mould should be 2 feet 6 inches long and 1 foot
4 inches high. <a href="#Fig_111">Fig. 111</a> will show you how to cut off the ends
to give the proper slant. The dotted lines show the board before
it is trimmed in shape. By measuring along the edge of the board
from each end 10.8 inches and marking the points, and then, with
a carpenter's pencil ruling the diagonal lines to the other edge and
ends of the board, the triangles may be sawed off with a hand saw.</p>

<div class="caption">The simple details of the dory.</div>
</div>

<p><a href="#Fig_111">Fig. 111</a> shows where the mould is to be placed in the center
of the two side boards. As the boards in this diagram are supposed
to be on the slant, and consequently in the perspective,
they do not appear as wide as they really are. The diagram is
made also with the ends of the side boards free so as to better
show the position of the mould. But when the side boards are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
sprung apart and the mould placed in position (<a href="#Fig_113">Fig. 113</a>), it will
appear as in <a href="#Fig_116">Fig. 116</a> or <a href="#Fig_117">Fig. 117</a>. <a href="#Fig_115">Fig. 115</a> shows the shape of
the stem-posts to be set in both bow and stern and nailed securely
in place.</p>

<p>When you have gone thus far fit in two temporary braces near
the bow and stern, as shown in <a href="#Fig_117">Fig. 117</a>. These braces are simply
narrow pieces of boards held in position by nails driven
through the outside of the boat, the latter left with their heads
protruding, so that they may be easily drawn when necessary.</p>

<p>Now turn the boat over bottom up and you will find that the
angle at which the sides are bent will cause the bottom boards
to rest upon a thin edge of the side boards, as shown in <a href="#Fig_119">Fig. 119</a>.
With an ordinary jack-plane trim this down so that the bottom
boards will rest flush and
snug, as in <a href="#Fig_120">Fig. 120</a>.</p>

<h3>How to Calk a Boat so That
It Won't Leak</h3>

<p>If you wish to make a
bottom that will never leak,
not even when it is placed in the water for the first time, plane off
the boards on their sides, so that when fitted together they will
leave a triangular groove between each board, as shown in Fig.
<a href="#Fig_118_5">118½</a>. These grooves will show upon the inside of the boat, and not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
upon the outside, and in this case the calking is done from the
inside and not from the outside. They are first calked with
candlewick, over which putty is used, but for a rough boat it is
not even necessary to use any calking. When the planks swell
they will be forced together, so as to exclude all water.</p>

<p>To fasten the bottom on the boat put a board lengthwise at the
end, as shown in <a href="#Fig_121">Fig. 121</a>. One end shows the end board as it is
first nailed on, and the other end shows it after it has been trimmed
off to correspond with the sides of the boat. Now put your short
pieces of boards for the bottom on one at a time, driving each one
snug up against its neighbor before nailing it in place and leaving
the rough or irregular ends of each board protrude on each side,
as shown at the right-hand end of <a href="#Fig_121">Fig. 121</a>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 679px;"><a id="Fig_117"></a><a id="Fig_119"></a><a id="Fig_120"></a><a id="Fig_121"></a>
<img src="images/i_085.png" width="679" height="295" alt="Fig. 117. Fig. 119.  Fig. 120.  Fig. 121." />
<div class="caption">Top view with sides in place, also reversed view showing how bottom boards are laid.</div>
</div>

<p>When all the boards are nailed in place (by beginning at one
end and fitting them against each other until the other end is
reached) they may be trimmed off with a saw (<a href="#Fig_121">Fig. 121</a>) and
your boat is finished with the exception of the thwarts, or seats.</p>

<p>If you intend to propel this with paddles like a canoe, you will
need a seat in the centre for your passenger, and this may be
placed in the position occupied by the form (<a href="#Fig_111">Figs. 111</a> and <a href="#Fig_117">117</a>)
after the latter is removed. To fit a seat in it is only necessary to
cut two cleats and nail them to the sides of the boat for the seat
to rest upon and saw off a board the proper length to fit upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
cleats. It would be well now to fasten the braces in the bow and
stern permanently, adjusting them to suit your convenience.
The seat should be as low as possible for safety. With this your
paddling dory is finished, and may be used even without being
painted. A coat of paint, however, improves not only the looks
but the tightness and durability of any boat.</p>

<p>We have now advanced so far in our boat-building that it
becomes necessary that the beginner should learn more about
boats and boating, and since this book is written for beginners,
we will take it for granted that they know absolutely nothing
about the subject and will give all the rudimentary knowledge
for landlubbers in the next chapter.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII<br />
<small>THE LANDLUBBER'S CHAPTER</small></h2>

<div class='summary1'>Common Nautical Terms and Expressions Defined&mdash;How to Sail
a Boat&mdash;Boat Rigs&mdash;Rowing-clothes&mdash;How to Make a Bathing-suit&mdash;How
to Avoid Sunburn</div>


<p><span class="smcap">There</span> are a few common terms with which all who venture
on the water should be familiar, not only for convenience, but
for prudential reasons.</p>

<p>Accidents are liable to happen to boats of all descriptions, and
often the safety of property and life depend upon the passengers'
ability to understand what is said to them by the officers or sailors
in charge of the craft.</p>

<p>To those who are familiar with the water and shipping it may
seem absurd to define the bow and stern of a boat, but there are
people who will read this book who cannot tell the bow from
the stern, so we will begin this chapter with the statement that</p>

<p><b>The bow</b> is the front end of the boat, and</p>

<p><b>The stern</b> is the rear end of the boat.</p>

<p><b>For'ard</b> is toward the bow of the boat.</p>

<p><b>Aft</b> is toward the stern of the boat. Both terms are used by
sailors as forward and backward are used by landsmen.</p>

<p><b>The hull</b> is the boat itself without masts, spars, or rigging. A
skiff and a birch-bark canoe are hulls.</p>

<p><b>The keel</b> is the piece of timber running along the centre of the
bottom of the hull, like the runner of a skate, and used to give
the boat a hold on the water, so that she will not slide sideways.</p>

<p>When you are sitting in the stern of a boat, facing the bow,
the side next to your right hand is the right-hand side of the boat,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
and the side next to your left hand is the left-hand side of the boat.
But these terms are not used by seamen; they always say</p>

<p><b>Starboard</b> for the right-hand side of the boat, and</p>

<p><b>Port</b> for the left-hand side of the boat. Formerly the left-hand
side was called the larboard, but this occasioned many serious
mistakes on account of the similarity of the sound of larboard and
starboard when used in giving orders.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><a id="Fig_122"></a>

</div>


<h3>Red and Green Lights</h3>

<p>After dark a red light is carried on the port side and a green
light on the starboard side of all vessels in motion. If you can
remember that port wine is red, and that the port light is of the
same color, you will always be able to tell in which direction an
approaching craft is pointing by the relative location of the lights.</p>

<div class='poem'>
"When both lights you see ahead,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Port your helm and show your red!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Green to green and red to red,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">You're all right, and go ahead!"</span><br />
</div>

<p>If you are a real landlubber, the verse quoted will be of little
service, because you will not know how to port your helm. In
fact, you probably will not know where to look for the helm or
what it looks like; but only a few of our readers are out-and-out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
landlubbers, and most of them know that the helm is in some
way connected with the steering apparatus.</p>

<p><b>The rudder</b> is the movable piece of board at the stern of the
boat by means of which the craft is guided. The rudder is moved
by a lever, ropes, or a wheel.</p>

<p><b>The tiller</b> is the lever for moving the rudder, or the ropes used
for the same purpose (<a href="#Fig_123">Fig. 123</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><a id="Fig_123"></a>
<img src="images/i_089.png" width="600" height="373" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 123.&mdash;Helm&mdash;Lever, or stick, for tiller.</div>
</div>

<p><b>The wheel</b> is the wheel whose spokes end in handles on the
outer edge of the rim, or felly, and it is used for moving the rudder
(<a href="#Fig_124">Fig. 124</a>).</p>

<p><b>The helm</b> is that particular part of the steering apparatus that
you put your hands on when steering.</p>

<p><b>The deck</b> is the roof of the hull.</p>

<p><b>The centreboard</b> is an adjustable keel that can be raised or
lowered at pleasure. It is an American invention. The centreboard,
as a rule, is only used on comparatively small vessels.
The inventor of the centreboard is Mr. Salem Wines, who kept
a shop on Water Street, near Market Slip, and, when alive, was a
well-known New York boat-builder. His body now lies in Greenwood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
Cemetery, and upon the headstone of his grave is the
inscription, "The Inventor of the Centreboard."</p>

<p>For sailing, the boat, or hull, is rigged with masts and spars
for spreading the sails to catch the wind.</p>

<p><b>The masts</b> are the upright poles, or sticks, that hold the sails.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><a id="Fig_124"></a>
<img src="images/i_090.png" width="600" height="482" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 124.&mdash;Helm&mdash;The wheel.</div>
</div>

<p><b>The yards</b> are the poles, or sticks, at right angles with the masts
that spread the sails.</p>

<p><b>The boom</b> is the movable spar at the bottom of the sail.</p>

<p><b>The gaff</b> is the pole, or spar, for spreading the top, or head, of
the sail (<a href="#Fig_125">Fig. 125</a>).</p>

<p><b>The sail</b> is a big canvas kite, of which the boom, gaff, and masts
are the kite-sticks. You must not understand by this that the
sail goes soaring up in the air, for the weight of the hull prevents
that; but if you make fast a large kite to the mast of a boat it
would be a sail, and if you had a line long and strong enough,
and should fasten any spread sail to it, there can be no doubt that
the sail would fly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p><b>The spars</b> are the masts, bowsprit, yards, and gaffs.</p>

<p><b>The bowsprit</b> is the stick, or sprit, projecting from the bow of the
boat (<a href="#Fig_161">Fig. 161</a>, Sloop).</p>

<p><b>The foremast</b> is the mast next to the bow&mdash;the forward mast
(<a href="#Fig_159">Fig. 159</a>, Ship).</p>

<p><b>The mainmast</b> is the second mast&mdash;the mast next to the foremast.</p>

<p><b>Mizzen-mast</b> is the mast next to and back of the mainmast
(<a href="#Fig_159">Fig. 159</a>, Ship).</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 315px;"><a id="Fig_125"></a>
<img src="images/i_091.png" width="315" height="366" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 125.&mdash;A sail.</div>
</div>

<p><b>The rigging</b> of a boat consists of the ropes, or lines, attached to
its masts and sails, but a boat's rig refers to the
number of masts as well as to the shape of its
sails.</p>

<p><b>Stays</b> are strong ropes supporting the masts,
fore and aft.</p>

<p><b>Shrouds</b> are strong ropes reaching from the
mastheads to the sides of the vessel; supports
for the masts, starboard and port.</p>

<p><b>Ratlines</b> are the little ropes that form the
steps, or foot ropes, that run crosswise between the shrouds.</p>

<p><b>The painter</b> is the rope at the bow of a small boat, used for the
same purpose as is a hitching-strap on a horse.</p>

<p><b>The standing rigging</b> consists of the stays and shrouds.</p>

<p><b>The running rigging</b> consists of all the ropes used in handling
yards and sails.</p>

<p><b>The sheets</b> are the ropes, or lines, attached to the corners of sails,
by which they are governed (<a href="#Fig_126">Fig. 126</a>).</p>

<p><b>The main sheet</b> is the rope that governs the mainsail.</p>

<p><b>The jib-sheet</b> is the rope that governs the jib-sail.</p>

<p><b>The gaskets</b> are the ropes used in lashing the sails when furled.</p>

<p><b>The braces</b> are the ropes used in swinging the yards around.</p>

<p><b>The jib-stay</b> is the stay that runs from the foremast to the
bowsprit.</p>

<p><b>The bob-stay</b> is practically an extension of the jib-stay and the
chief support of the spars. It connects the bow of the boat with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
the bowsprit and prevents the latter from bobbing up and
down.</p>

<p>Besides the port and starboard sides of a boat there are the
windward and leeward sides. Do not understand by this that the
boat has four sides, like a square. Windward may be the port
or the starboard side, according to the direction the wind blows;
because</p>

<p><b>Windward</b> means the side of the boat against which the wind
blows&mdash;the side where the wind climbs aboard; or it may mean
the direction from which the wind comes. The opposite side
is called</p>

<p><b>Leeward</b>&mdash;that is, the side of the boat opposite to that against
which the wind blows, where the wind tumbles overboard, or the
side opposite to windward. When you are sailing you may be
near a</p>

<p><b>Lee Shore</b>&mdash;that is, the shore on your lee side against which
the wind blows; or a</p>

<p><b>Windward Shore</b>&mdash;that is, the land on your windward side
from which the wind blows.</p>

<p>All seamen dread a lee shore, as it is a most dangerous shore to
approach, from the fact that the wind is doing its best to blow
you on the rocks or beach. But the windward shore can be approached
with safety, because the wind will keep you off the
rocks, and if it is blowing hard, the land will break the force of
the wind.</p>

<p>In a canoe or shell the boatman sits either directly on the bottom,
or, as in the shell, very close to it, and the weight of his body
serves to keep the boat steady, but larger crafts seldom rely upon
live weights to steady them. They use</p>

<p><b>Ballast</b>&mdash;that is, weights of stone, lead, iron, or sand-bags,
used to balance the boat and make her steady.</p>

<p>As has been said before in this chapter, the sail is a big canvas
kite made fast to the boat and called a sail, but the ordinary kite
has its covering stretched permanently on rigid sticks.</p>

<p>The sail, however, can be stretched to its full extent or only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
partially, or it may be rolled up, exposing nothing but the masts
to the force of the wind. To accomplish all this there are various
ropes and attachments, all of which are named.</p>

the sail (<a href="#Fig_127">Fig. 127</a>).</p>

<h3>How to Steer a Boat</h3>

<p>When you wish your boat to turn to the right push your helm
to the left. This will push the rudder to the right and turn the
boat in that direction. When you wish your boat to turn to the
left push your helm to the right. In other words, starboard your
helm and you will turn to the port (<a href="#Fig_128">Fig. 128</a>). Port your helm
and you will turn to the starboard (<a href="#Fig_129">Fig. 129</a>).</p>

<p>From a reference to the diagram you may see that when you
<b>port your helm</b> you move the tiller to the port side of the boat,
and when you <b>starboard your helm</b> you move your tiller to the
starboard side of the boat (<a href="#Fig_128">Fig. 128</a>), but to <b>ease your helm</b> you
move your helm toward the centre of the boat&mdash;that is, amidships.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>


<h3>How to Sail a Boat</h3>

<p>If you fasten the bottom of a kite to the ground, you will find
that the wind will do its best to blow the kite over, and if the kite
is fastened to the mast of a toy boat, the wind will try to blow the
boat over.</p>

<p>In sailing a boat the effort of the wind apparently has but one
object, and that is the upsetting of the boat. The latter, being
well balanced, is constantly endeavoring to sit upright on its keel,
and you, as a sailor, are aiding the boat in the struggle, at the
same time subverting the purpose of the wind to suit your own
ideas. It is an exciting game, in which man usually comes out
ahead, but the wind gains enough victories to keep its courage up.</p>

<p>Every boat has peculiarities of its own, and good traits as well
as bad ones, which give the craft a personal character that lends
much to your interest, and even affects your sensibilities to the
extent of causing you to have the same affection for a good, trustworthy
craft that you have for an intelligent and kind dog or
horse.</p>

<p>A properly balanced sail-boat, with main sheet trimmed flat
and free helm, should be as sensitive as a weathercock and act
like one&mdash;that is, she ought to swing around until her bow pointed
right into the "eye of the wind," the direction from which the
wind blows. Such a craft it is not difficult to sail, but it frequently
happens that the boat that is given to you to sail is not properly
balanced, and shows a constant tendency to "come up in the
wind"&mdash;face the wind&mdash;when you are doing your best to keep her
sails full and keep her on her course. This may be caused by too
much sail aft. The boat is then said to carry a weather helm.</p>

<p><b>Weather Helm.</b>&mdash;When a boat shows a constant tendency to
come up in the wind.</p>

<p><b>Lee Helm.</b>&mdash;When a boat shows a constant tendency to fall
off the wind&mdash;that is, when the wind blows her bow to the leeward.
This is a much worse trait than the former, and a boat with a lee
helm is a dangerous boat. It may be possible to remedy it by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
adding sail aft or reducing sail forward, which should immediately
be done.</p>

<p>In spite of the fact, already stated, that the wind's constant
effort is to capsize a boat, there is little or no danger of a properly
rigged boat upsetting unless the sheets are fast or hampered in
some way. When a sail-boat upsets it is, of course, because the
wind blows it over. Now, the wind cannot blow a boat over
unless the boat presents some surface larger than its hull for the
wind to blow against, and the sail is the only object that offers
enough surface to the breeze to cause an upset.</p>

<p>If the sheet is slackened, the sail will swing around until it
flaps like a flag and only the thin edge is presented to the wind;
and a boat that a flag will upset is no boat for beginners to trust
themselves in. True, the boom may be very long and heavy
enough to make it dangerous to let so much of it overboard, but
this is seldom the case. A good sailor keeps his eyes constantly
on the sails and trims them to take advantage of the slightest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
favorable breeze. In place of losing control of his sail by letting
go the sheets he will ease the tiller so as to "spill" part of the wind
that is, let the forward part, or luff, of the sail shake a bit. Or,
in case of a sudden puff of wind, he may deem it necessary to
"luff"&mdash;that is, let her shake&mdash;and slacken the sheets too.</p>

<p><b>Trimmed Flat.</b>&mdash;Sheets hauled in until the boom is only a little
to the leeward of the helm (<a href="#Fig_130">Fig. 130</a>).</p>

<p><b>Close-hauled.</b>&mdash;Sheets trimmed flat and the boat pointing as
near as possible to the eye of the wind. Then the sail cannot
belly, and is called flat (<a href="#Fig_130">Fig. 130</a>).</p>


<h3>To Sail Close-hauled</h3>

<p>The skipper must watch that his sail does not flap or ripple at
the throat, for that means that he is pointing too close to the
wind and that some of the breeze is blowing on both sides of
his sail, which even a novice can see will retard the boat.</p>

<p>Upon discovering a rippling motion at the luff of the sail put
the helm up&mdash;that is, move the tiller a little to windward until the
sail stops its flapping.</p>

<p><b>Before the Wind.</b>&mdash;When the wind is astern; sailing with the
wind; sailing directly from windward to leeward (<a href="#Fig_131">Fig. 131</a>).</p>

<p>In order to reach the desired point it is often expedient to sail
before the wind, but unless the wind is light, beginners had
better not try this. To sail before the wind you let your sheets
out until the boom stands at <i>almost</i> right angles with the boat.
Keep your eye on the sail and see that it does not flap, for if the
man at the helm is careless and allows the boat to point enough
away from the direction of the wind to allow the wind to get on
the other side of the sail, the latter will swing around or jibe with
such force as to endanger the mast, if it does not knock some one
overboard.</p>

<p>The price of liberty is constant vigilance, and the price of a
good sail is the same. I have seen a mast snapped off clean at
the deck by a jibe, and once when out after ducks every one was
so intent upon the game that proper attention was not paid to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
the sail. The wind got round and brought the boom with a
swing aft, knocking the captain of our boat club overboard.
Had the boom hit him in the head and stunned him, the result
might have been fatal.</p>

in the same position on the starboard side she is said to be wing
and wing and presents a beautiful sight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Tacking.</b>&mdash;Working to the windward by a series of diagonal
moves.</p>

<p><b>Legs.</b>&mdash;The moves or diagonal courses made in tacking. It is
apparent to the most unthinking observer that no vessel propelled
by sail can move against the direct course of the wind&mdash;that is,
nothing but electricity, naphtha, steam, or some such power can
drive a boat into the eye of the wind. But what cannot be accomplished
in a direct manner can be done by a series of compromises,
each of which will bring us nearer to the desired
point.</p>

<p>First we point the boat to the right or left, as the case may be,
as near or as close to the wind as the boat will sail. Then we
come about and sail in the other direction as close as practicable
to the eye of the wind, and each time we gain something in a direct
line.</p>

<p>When your boat changes its direction on a tack it is done by
"jibing," or "coming about."</p>

<p><b>Jibing.</b>&mdash;With the wind on the quarter, haul the main boom
aft or amidship with all possible speed, by means of the main
sheets (<a href="#Fig_132">Fig. 132</a>), and as the wind strikes the sail on the other
side let it out as deliberately as possible until it reaches the position
desired (<a href="#Fig_133">Fig. 133</a>).</p>

<p>Beginners should never attempt to jibe, for if there is more
than a capful of wind, the sail will probably get away from them,
and, as described in going before the wind, some disaster is liable
to occur. Experts only jibe in light winds, and frequently lower
the peak, so as to reduce sail, before attempting a jibe.</p>


<h3>Coming About</h3>

<p>When you wish to come about see that all the tackle, ropes,
etc., are clear and in working order, and that you are making
good headway; then call out: "Helm's a-lee!" or "Ready about!"
and push the tiller in the direction opposite to that from which the
wind blows&mdash;that is, to the lee side of the boat. This will bring
the bow around until the wind strikes the sail upon the side opposite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
to that which it struck before the helm was a-lee (<a href="#Fig_134">Figs.
134</a>, <a href="#Fig_135">135</a>, <a href="#Fig_136">136</a>, <a href="#Fig_137">137</a>).</p>

<p>If you are aboard a sloop or schooner, ease off the jib-sheet, but
keep control of it, so that as the boat comes up to the wind you
can make the jib help the bow around by holding the sheets so as
to catch the wind aback. When the bow of the craft has passed
the eye of the wind and the sail begins to fill give the order to
make fast, or trim, the jib, and off you go upon the opposite tack,
or on a new leg.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 586px;"><a id="Fig_134"></a><a id="Fig_135"></a><a id="Fig_136"></a><a id="Fig_137"></a>

<div class="caption">Figs. 134, 135, 136, and 137.&mdash;Coming about.</div>
</div>

<p>If the wind is light, or if, for any cause, the boat works slowly,
you can sometimes help her by trimming in the main sheet when
you let the jib-sheet fly. In the diagram of coming about no
jib is shown.</p>

<p><b>Wearing</b> is a term sometimes used in place of jibing.</p>


<h3>In a Thunder-storm</h3>

<p>A thunder-storm is always an uncertain thing. There may be
a veritable tornado hidden in the black clouds that we see rising
on the horizon, or it may simply "iron out the wind"&mdash;that is,
go grumbling overhead&mdash;and leave us becalmed, to get home the
best way we can; generally by what the boys call a "white-ash
breeze"&mdash;that is, by using the sweeps or oars.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>On Long Island Sound a thunder-storm seems to have certain
fixed rules of conduct. In the first place, it comes up from the
leeward, or <i>against the wind</i>. Just before the storm strikes you
for an instant the wind ceases and the sails flap idly. Then look
out! for in nine cases out of ten you are struck the next moment
by a sudden squall from exactly the opposite direction from which
the wind blew a moment before.</p>


<h3>What to Do</h3>

<p>Make for the nearest port with all speed, and keep a man at the
downhaul ready at a moment's notice to lower sail. The moment
the wind stops drop the sail and make everything snug, leaving
only bare poles. When the thunder-squall strikes you, be it
ever so hard, you are now in little danger; and if the wind from
the new quarter is not too fresh, you can hoist sail again and make
the best of your way to the nearest port, where you can "get in
out of the wet."</p>

<p>If the wind is quite fresh keep your peak down, and with a
reefed sail speed on your way. If it is a regular howler, let your
boat drive before the wind under bare poles until you can find
shelter or until it blows over, and the worst mishap you are likely
to incur is a good soaking from the rain.</p>

<p><b>Shortening Sail.</b>&mdash;Just as soon as the boat heels over too far
for safety, or as soon as you are convinced that there is more wind
than you need for comfortable sailing, it is time to take a reef&mdash;that
is, to roll up the bottom of the sail to the row of little ropes,
or reefing points, on the sail and make fast there. This, of course,
makes a smaller sail, and that is what you wish.</p>

<p>While under way it will be found impossible to reef a sail except
when sailing close-hauled. So the boat is brought up into
the wind by pushing the helm down, as if you intended to come
about. When possible it is better to lower the sail entirely before
attempting to put in a reef.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>


<h3>To Reef Without Lowering Sail</h3>

<p>It sometimes happens that on account of the proximity of a
lee shore, and the consequent danger of drifting in that direction,
or for some other equally good reason, it is inadvisable to lower
sail and lose headway. Under such circumstances the main
sheet must be trimmed flat, keeping the boat as close as possible
to the wind, the helm must be put up hard a-lee, and jib-sheet
trimmed to windward (<a href="#Fig_138">Fig. 138</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 410px;"><a id="Fig_138"></a>
<img src="images/i_102.png" width="410" height="420" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 138.&mdash;Squirming; jib on port side, boom close-hauled
on starboard side.</div>
</div>

<p>When this is done the wind will hit the jib, "paying her head
off," or pushing her bow to leeward, and this tendency is counteracted
by the helm and mainsail, bringing the bow up into the
wind. This keeps the boat squirming. Lower the mainsail
until the row of reef points is just on a line with the boom, keeping
to the windward of the sail. Tie the first point&mdash;that is, the one
on the luff rope&mdash;then the one on the leach, being careful to stretch
out the foot of the sail. Then tie the remaining points, always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
making a square or reefing knot. Tie them to the jack-stay on
the boom or around the boom.</p>


<h3>The Reef or Square Knot</h3>

<div class='unindent'>is most frequently used, as its name implies, in reefing sails.
First make a plain overhand knot, as in <a href="#Fig_139">Fig. 139</a>. Then repeat
the operation by taking the end and passing it
over and under the loop, drawing the parts
tight, as shown in <a href="#Fig_140">Fig. 140</a>. Care should be
observed in crossing the ends so that they will
always lay fairly alongside the main parts.
Otherwise the knot will prove a <i>granny</i> and be comparatively
worthless.</div>

<div class="caption">Figs. 139 and 140.&mdash;Square

</div>


<h3>To Shake Out a Reef</h3>

<div class='unindent'>untie the knots, keeping to the windward of the sail. Untie the
knot at the leach first, next the one at the luff, and then the remaining
points. In lowering a sail you use a rope called the
<b>downhaul</b>.</div>

<p><b>Starboard Tack.</b>&mdash;When the main boom is over the port side.</p>

<p><b>Port Tack.</b>&mdash;When the main boom is over the starboard side.</p>

<p><b>Right of Way.</b>&mdash;All boats sailing on the starboard tack have
the right of way over all those on the port tack. In other words,
if you are on the starboard tack, those on the port tack must keep
out of your way. Any boat sailing close-hauled has the right of
way over a boat sailing free.</p>


<h3>Lights for Canoe</h3>

<p>A canoe under sail at night should have an uncolored lantern
hung to her mizzen-mast to notify other craft that she is out and
objects to being run down. The light is put on the mizzen so that
it may be behind the skipper and not dazzle him.</p>

<p>What you have read in the foregoing pages will not be found
very difficult to remember, but there is only one way to learn to
sail and that is by <i>sailing</i>. If possible, sail with some one who is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
a good seaman. If this sort of companion cannot be had, try it
alone on smooth water and with short sail until you accustom
yourself to the boat and its peculiarities. No boy ever learned
to skate or swim from books, but books often have been helpful
in giving useful hints to those who were really learning by practical
experience.</p>


<h3>Some Do Nots</h3>

<div class='poem2'>
Do not overload the boat.<br />
Do not carry too much sail.<br />
Do not sail in strange waters without chart or compass.<br />
Do not forget your anchor.<br />
Do not forget your paddles or oars.<br />
Do not attempt to learn to sail before you know how to swim.<br />
Do not sit on the gunwale.<br />
Do not put the helm down too suddenly or too far.<br />
Do not let go the helm.<br />
Do not mistake caution for cowardice.<br />
Do not be afraid to reef.<br />
Do not fear the ridicule of other landlubbers.<br />
Do not fail to keep the halyards and sheets clear.<br />
Do not jibe in a stiff wind.<br />
Do not fail to keep your head in times of emergency.<br />
Do not make a display of bravery until the occasion demands it.<br />
Do not allow mistakes or mishaps to discourage you.<br />
Do not associate with a fool who rocks a boat.<br />
</div>

<p>You will soon become an expert and be able to engage in one of
our most exhilarating, healthy, and manly sports and earn the
proud distinction of being a good small-boat sailor.</p>


<h3>It is Necessary to Learn to Swim</h3>

<p>From the parents' point of view, nowhere that a boy's restless
nature impels him to go is fraught with so much peril as the water,
and nowhere is a boy happier than when he is on the water, unless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
it is when he is in it. Nowhere can be found a better school
for his young mind and body than that furnished by boating.
Hence it appears to be the imperative duty for parents personally
to see that their children are taught to swim as soon as their little
limbs have strength enough to make the proper motions.</p>


<h3>Boating-Clothes</h3>

<p>In aquatic sports of all kinds, if you expect to have fun, you
must dress appropriately. You should have a suit of old clothes
that you can change for dry ones when the sport is over. When
boating, it is nonsense to pretend you can keep dry under all the
varying conditions of wind and weather. If your purse is small,
and you want a good rowing-suit, it can be made of last winter's
woollen underclothes, and will answer for the double purpose of
rowing and bathing.</p>


<h3>How to Make a Bathing-Suit</h3>

<p>First take an old woollen undershirt and cut the sleeves off
above the elbows. Then coax your mother, aunt, or sister to sew
it up in front like a sweater, and hem the edges of the sleeves where
they have just been cut off.</p>

<p>Next take a pair of woollen drawers and have them sewed up in
front, leaving an opening at the top about four inches in length;
turn the top edge down all around to cover a piece of tape that
should be long enough to tie in front. Have this hem or flap
sewed down to cover the tape, and allow the two ends of the tape
to protrude at the opening in front. The tape should not be
sewed to the cloth, but should move freely, so that you can tighten
or loosen it at will. Cut the drawers off at the knees and have
the edges hemmed, and you will have a first-class bathing or
rowing-suit.</p>

<p>If woollen clothes are not to be had, cotton will do, but wool is
coolest and warmest, as the occasion may require.</p>

<p>When rowing wear old socks, woollen ones if you have them,
and old shoes cut down like slippers. The latter can be kicked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
off at a moment's notice, and, if lost, they are of no value, and
may be easily replaced.</p>

<p>When on shore a long pair of woollen stockings to cover your
bare legs and a sweater to pull over your sleeveless shirt are handy
and comfortable, but while sailing, paddling, or rowing in hot
weather the rowing-suit is generally all that comfort requires.
Of course, if your skin is tender, you are liable to be terribly sunburned
on your arms, neck, and legs; but</p>


<h3>Sunburn</h3>

<div class='unindent'>may be avoided by gradually accustoming your limbs to the exposure.
Dearly will you pay for your negligence if you go out
for a day with bare arms or legs in the hot sun before you have
toughened yourself, and little will you sleep that night.</div>

<p>I have seen young men going to business the day following a
regatta with no collars on their red necks, and no shirt over their
soft undershirts, the skin being too tender to bear the touch of the
stiff, starched linen, and I have known others who could not sleep
a wink on account of the feverish state of their bodies, caused by
the hot sun and a tender skin. Most boys have had some experience
from sunburn, acquired while bathing. If care is taken
to cover your arms and legs after about an hour's exposure, you
will find that in place of being blistered, your skin will be first
pink and then a faint brownish tint, which each succeeding exposure
will deepen until your limbs will assume that dark, rich
mahogany color of which athletes are so proud. This makes your
skin proof against future attacks of the hottest rays of the sun.</p>

<p>Besides the pain and discomfort of a sudden and bad sunburn
on your arms, the effect is not desirable, as it is very liable to
cover your arms with freckles. I have often seen men with
beautifully bronzed arms and freckled shoulders, caused by
going out in their shells first with short sleeves and then with
shirts from which the sleeves were entirely cut away, exposing
the white, tender shoulders to the fierce heat, to which they
were unaccustomed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>It is a good plan to cover the exposed parts of your body with
sweet-oil, vaseline, mutton-tallow, beef-tallow, or lard. This is
good as a preventive while in the sun, and excellent as an application
after exposure. Any sort of oil or grease that does not contain
salt is good for your skin.</p>


<h3>Clothes for Canoeing</h3>

<p>In canoeing I have found it convenient to dress as I would in a
shell boat, but I generally have had a sweater and a pair of long
trousers stowed away, ready to be pulled on over my rowing-clothes
when I landed. Once, when I neglected to put these
extra clothes aboard, I was storm-bound up Long Island Sound,
and, leaving my boat, I took the train home, but I did not enjoy
my trip, for the bare legs and arms and knit cap attracted more
attention than is pleasant for a modest man.</p>

<p>Do not wear laced shoes in a canoe, for experience has taught
boating-men that about the most inconvenient articles of clothing
to wear in the water are laced shoes. While swimming your feet
are of absolutely no use if incased in this style of foot-gear, and
all the work must be done with the arms. But if you have old
slippers, they may be kicked off, and then you are dressed practically
in a bathing-suit, and can swim with comfort and ease.</p>

<p>Possibly these precautions may suggest the idea that a ducking
is not at all an improbable accident, and it must be confessed
that the boy who thinks he can learn to handle small boats without
an occasional unlooked-for swim is liable to discover his mistake
before he has become master of his craft.</p>


<h3>Stick to Your Boat</h3>

<p>Always remember that a wet head is a very small object in
the water, and liable to be passed by unnoticed, but that a
capsized boat can scarcely fail to attract attention and insure a
speedy rescue from an awkward position. As for the real danger
of boating, it cannot be great where care is used. Not one fatality
has occurred on the water, among all of my large circle of boating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
friends, and personally I have never witnessed a fatal accident in
all the years I have spent rowing and sailing.</p>


<h3>Life-Preservers</h3>

<p>All canoes should have a good cork life-preserver in them when
the owner ventures away from land. I never but once ventured
any distance without one, and that is the only time I was ever in
need of a life-preserver. The ordinary cork jacket is best. It
can be used for a seat, and when spread on the bottom of your
canoe, with an old coat or some article thrown over it for a cushion,
it is not at all an uncomfortable seat. Most canoes have airtight
compartments fore and aft&mdash;that is, at both ends&mdash;and the
boat itself is then a good life-preserver. Even without the airtight
compartments, unless your boat is loaded with ballast or
freight, there is no danger of its sinking. A canvas canoe, as a
rule, has enough woodwork about it to support your weight when
the boat is full of water.</p>

<p>An upset canvas canoe supported me for an hour and a half
during a blow on Long Island Sound, and had not a passing
steamer rescued me, the canoe would evidently have buoyed me
up as long as I could have held on to the hull.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX<br />
<small>HOW TO RIG AND SAIL SMALL BOATS</small></h2>


<h3>How to Make a Lee-Board for a Canoe</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Now</span> that the open canvas canoe has become so popular the
demand has arisen for some arrangement by which it may be
used with sails. Of course it is an easy matter to rig sails on almost
any sort of craft, but unless there is a keel or a centreboard
the boat will make lee-way, <i>i. e.</i>, it will have no hold on the water,
and when you try to tack, the boat will blow sideways, which may
be fraught with serious results. The only time that the author
ever got in a serious scrape with his canoe, was when he carelessly
sailed out in a storm, leaving the key to his fan centreboard at
the boat-house. Being unable to let down the centreboard, he
was eventually driven out to sea, and when he became too fatigued
to move quickly was capsized.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 610px;"><a id="Fig_140_2"></a><a id="Fig_140a"></a>
<img src="images/i_110.png" width="610" height="525" alt="drawings" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 140.&mdash;Lee-board.  Fig. 140<i>a</i>.&mdash;Bolt and thumb-screw.</div>
</div>

<p>Now to prevent such occurrences and to do away with the inconvenience
of the centreboard in an open canoe, various designs
of lee-boards have been made. A lee-board is, practically speaking,
a double centreboard. The paddle-like form of the blades
of the boards given in <a href="#Fig_140_2">Fig. 140</a> give them a good hold on the
water when they are below the surface, and they can also be allowed
to swing clear of the water when temporarily out of use. Or
they may be removed and stowed away in the canoe. As you
see by the diagram the two blades are connected by a spruce
rod; the blades themselves may be made of some hard wood,
like cherry, and bevelled at the edges like a canoe-paddle.
They should be a scant foot in width and a few inches over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
two feet long, and cut out of three-quarter-inch material. The
spruce cross-bar is about one and a half inch in diameter, the
ends of which are thrust through a hole in the upper end of each
lee-board. A small hole is bored in the top of each lee-board,
down through the ends of the cross-board, and when a galvanized-iron
pin is pushed down through this hole, it will prevent the bar
from turning in its socket. A couple more galvanized-iron pins
or bars fit in holes in the spruce cross-bar, as shown in the diagram
(<a href="#Fig_140_2">Fig. 140</a>). At the top end of each of these metal bolts
is a thumb-screw which runs down over the thread of the bolt.
The bottom or lower end is bent at right angles that it may be
fitted under the gunwale of the canoe, and tightened by twisting
the thumb-screws. The advantage of this sort of arrangement
is that the lee-boards may be slid backward or forward and so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
adjusted that the canoe will sail in the direction in which it is
steered. The place where the lee-board is to be fastened can
only be found by experiment. When it is too far toward the
bow, the boat will show a desire to come up against the wind,
thus making work for the steersman to keep the wind in the sails.
If the lee-board is fastened too far toward the stern the canoe
will show a decided determination to swing around with its stern
to the wind, which is a dangerous trick for a well-trained craft to
indulge in.</p>

<p>I have seen open canvas canoes at the outfitting stores marked
as low as seventeen dollars, but they usually cost twenty-five dollars
or more, and I would advise ambitious canoeists to build
their own canoes, and even to make their own lee-boards,
although it would be cheaper to buy the latter.</p>


<h3>How to Rig and Sail Small Boats</h3>

<p>To have the tiller in one's own hands and feel competent, under
all ordinary circumstances, to bring a boat safely into port,
gives the same zest and excitement to a sail (only in a far greater
degree) that the handling of the whip and reins over a lively
trotter does to a drive.</p>

<p>Knowing and feeling this, it was my intention to devote a couple
of chapters to telling how to sail a boat; but through the kind
courtesy of the editor of <i>The American Canoeist</i>, I am able
to do much better by giving my readers a talk on this subject by
one whose theoretical knowledge and practical experience renders
him pre-eminently fit to give reliable advice and counsel. The
following is what Mr. Charles Ledyard Norton, editor of the
above-mentioned journal, says:</p>

<p>Very many persons seem to ignore the fact that a boy who
knows how to manage a gun is, upon the whole, less likely to be
shot than one who is a bungler through ignorance, or that a good
swimmer is less likely to be drowned than a poor one. Such,
however, is the truth beyond question. If a skilled sportsman is
now and then shot, or an expert swimmer drowned, the fault is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
not apt to be his own, and if the one who is really to blame had
received proper training, it is not likely that the accident would
have occurred at all. The same argument holds good with
regard to the management of boats, and the author is confident
that he merits the thanks of mothers, whether he receives them or
not, for giving their boys a few hints as to practical rigging and
sailing.</p>

<p>In general, there are three ways of learning how to sail boats.
First, from the light of nature, which is a poor way; second, from
books, which is better; and third, from another fellow who knows
how, which is best of all. I will try to make this article as much
like the other fellow and as little bookish as possible.</p>

<p>Of course, what I shall say in these few paragraphs will be
of small use to those who live within reach of the sea or some
big lake and have always been used to boats; but there are
thousands and thousands of boys and men who never saw the
sea, nor even set eyes on a sail, and who have not the least idea
how to make the wind take them where they want to go. I once
knew some young men from the interior who went down to the
sea-side and hired a boat, with the idea that they had nothing to
do but hoist the sail and be blown wherever they liked. The
result was that they performed a remarkable set of man&oelig;uvres
within sight of the boat-house, and at last went helplessly out to
sea and had to be sent after and brought back, when they were
well laughed at for their performances, and had reason to consider
themselves lucky for having gotten off so cheaply.</p>

<p>The general principles of sailing are as simple as the national
game of "one ole cat." That is to say, if the wind always blew
moderately and steadily, it would be as easy and as safe to sail a
boat as it is to drive a steady old family horse of good and regular
habits. The fact, however, is that winds and currents are variable
in their moods, and as capable of unexpected freaks as
the most fiery of unbroken colts; but when properly watched
and humored they are tractable and fascinating playmates and
servants.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>Now, let us come right down to first principles. Take a bit
of pine board, sharpen it at one end, set up a mast about a
quarter of the length of the whole piece from the bow, fit on a
square piece of stiff paper or card for a sail, and you are ready
for action. Put this in the water, with the sail set squarely
across (A, <a href="#Fig_141">Fig. 141</a>), and she will run off before the wind&mdash;which
is supposed to be blowing as indicated by the arrow&mdash;at a good
rate of speed. If she does not steer herself, put a small weight
near the stern, or square end; or, if you like, arrange a thin bit
of wood for a rudder.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 496px;"><a id="Fig_141"></a>
<img src="images/i_113.png" width="496" height="368" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 141. Lesson in sailing for beginners.</div>
</div>

<p>Probably the first primeval man who was born with nautical
instincts discovered this fact, and, using a bush for a sail,
greatly astonished his fellow primevals by winning some prehistoric
regatta. But that was all he could do. He was as helpless
as a balloonist is in midair. He could go, but he could not
get back, and we may be sure that ages passed away before the
possibility of sailing to windward was discovered.</p>

<p>Now, put up or "step" another mast and sail like the first,
about as far from the stern as the first is from the bow. Turn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
the two sails at an angle of forty-five degrees across the boat
(B or C, <a href="#Fig_141">Fig. 141</a>) and set her adrift. She will make considerable
progress across the course of the wind, although she will at
the same time drift with it. If she wholly refuses to go in the
right direction, place a light weight on her bow, so that she will
be a little "down by the head," or move the aftermost mast and
sail a little nearer to the stern.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 568px;"><a id="Fig_142"></a>
<img src="images/i_114.png" width="568" height="274" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 142.&mdash;Tacking.</div>
</div>

<p>The little rude affair thus used for experiment will not actually
make any progress to windward, because she is so light that she
moves sidewise almost as easily as she does forward. With a
larger, deeper boat, and with sails which can be set at any angle,
the effect will be different. So long as the wind presses against
the after side of the sail, the boat will move through the water in
the direction of the least resistance, which is forward. A square
sail having the mast in the middle was easiest to begin with for
purposes of explanation; but now we will change to a "fore-and-aft"
rig&mdash;that is, one with the mast at the forward edge or "luff"
of the sail, as in <a href="#Fig_142">Fig. 142</a>. Suppose the sail to be set at the angle
shown, and the wind blowing as the arrow points. The boat cannot
readily move sidewise, because of the broadside resistance;
she does not move backward, because the wind is pressing on the
aftermost side of the sail. So she very naturally moves forward.
When she nears buoy No. 1, the helmsman moves the "tiller," or
handle of the rudder, toward the sail. This causes the boat to
turn her head toward buoy No. 2, the sail swings across to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
other side of the boat and fills on that side, which now in turn becomes
the aftermost, and she moves toward buoy No. 2 nearly at
right angles to her former course. Thus, through a series of zigzags,
the wind is made to work against itself. This operation is
called "tacking," or "working to windward," and the act of turning,
as at the buoys No. 1 and No. 2, is called "going about."</p>

<p>It will be seen, then, that the science of sailing lies in being
able to manage a boat with her head pointing at any possible
angle to or from the wind. Nothing but experience can teach
one all the niceties of the art, but a little aptitude and address will
do to start with, keeping near shore and carrying little sail.</p>


<h3>Simplest Rig Possible</h3>

<p>I will suppose that the reader has the use of a broad, flat-bottomed
boat without any rudder. (See <a href="#Fig_143">Fig. 143</a>.) She cannot
be made to work like a racing yacht under canvas, but lots
of fun can be had out of her.</p>

<p>Do not go to any considerable expense at the outset. Procure
an old sheet, or an old hay cover, six or eight feet square,
and experiment with that before spending your money on new
material. If it is a sheet, and somewhat weakly in its texture,
turn all the edges in and sew them, so that it shall not give way
at the hems. At each corner sew on a few inches of strong twine,
forming loops at the angles. Sew on, also, eyelets or small loops
along the edge which is intended for the luff of the sail, so that it
can be laced to the mast.</p>

<p>You are now ready for your spars, namely, a mast and a
"sprit," the former a couple of feet longer than the luff of the sail,
and the latter to be cut off when you find how long you want it.
Let these spars be of pine, or spruce, or bamboo&mdash;as light as possible,
especially the sprit. An inch and a half diameter will do
for the mast, and an inch and a quarter for the sprit, tapering to
an inch at the top. To "step" the mast, bore a hole through one
of the thwarts (seats) near the bow and make a socket or step on
the bottom of the boat, just under the aforesaid hole&mdash;or if anything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
a trifle farther forward&mdash;to receive the foot of the mast.
This will hold the mast upright, or with a slight "rake" aft.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 636px;"><a id="Fig_143"></a>
<img src="images/i_116.png" width="636" height="404" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 143.&mdash;A simple rig.</div>
</div>

<p>Lace the luff of the sail to the mast so that its lower edge will
swing clear by a foot or so of the boat's sides. Make fast to the
loop at D a stout line, ten or twelve feet long. This is called the
"sheet," and gives control of the sail. The upper end of the sprit,
C, E, is trimmed so that the loop at C will fit over it but not slip
down. The lower end is simply notched to receive a short line
called a "snotter," as shown in the detailed drawing at the right of
the cut (<a href="#Fig_143">Fig. 143</a>). It will be readily understood that, when the
sprit is pushed upward in the direction of C, the sail will stand
spread out. The line is placed in the notch at E and pulled up
until the sail sets properly, when it is made fast to a cleat or to a
cross-piece at F. This device is in common use and has its advantages,
but a simple loop for the foot of the sprit to rest in is
more easily made and will do nearly as well. H is an oar for
steering. Having thus described the simplest rig possible, we
may turn our attention to more elegant and elaborate but not
always preferable outfits.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>


<h3>Leg-of-Mutton Rig</h3>
<div class="figleft" style="width: 201px;"><a id="Fig_144"></a>
<img src="images/i_117.png" width="201" height="281" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 144.</div>
</div>
<p>One of the prettiest and most convenient rigs for a small
boat is known as the "leg-of-mutton sharpie rig" (<a href="#Fig_144">Fig. 144</a>).
The sail is triangular, and the sprit, instead of reaching to its
upper corner, stands nearly at right angles to the mast. It is held
in position at the mast by the devices already described. This
rig has the advantage of keeping the whole sail flatter than any
other, for the end of the sprit cannot "kick
up," as the phrase goes, and so the sail holds
all the wind it receives.</p>



<p><a href="#Fig_145">Fig. 145</a> shows a device, published for the
first time in the <i>St. Nicholas Magazine</i> for
September, 1880, which enables the sailor to
step and unstep his mast, and hoist or lower
his sail without leaving his seat&mdash;a matter of
great importance when the boat is light and
tottlish, as in the case of that most beautiful
of small craft, the modern canoe, where the
navigator sits habitually amidships. The
lower mast (A, B, <a href="#Fig_145">Fig. 145</a>) stands about two and a half feet
above the deck. It is fitted at the head with a metal ferrule
and pin, and just above the deck with two half-cleats or other
similar devices (A). The topmast (C, D) is fitted at F with a
stout ring, and has double halyards (E) rove through or around
its foot. The lower mast being in position (see lower part of <a href="#Fig_145">Fig.
145</a>), the canoeist desiring to make sail brings the boat's head to
the wind, takes the topmast with the sail loosely furled in one
hand and the halyards in the other. It is easy for him by raising
this mast, without leaving his seat, to pass the halyards one on
each side of the lower mast and let them fall into place close to the
deck under the half-cleats at A. Then, holding the halyards taut
enough to keep them in position, he will hook the topmast ring
over the pin in the lower mast-heat and haul away (see top part
of <a href="#Fig_145">Fig. 145</a>). The mast will rise into place, where it is made fast.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
A collar of leather, or a knob of some kind, placed on the topmast
just below the ring, will act as a fulcrum when the halyards
are hauled taut and keep the mast from working to and fro.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><a id="Fig_145"></a>
<img src="images/i_118.png" width="600" height="984" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 145.&mdash;A new device.</div>
</div>

<p>The advantages of the rig are obvious. The mast can be
raised without standing up, and in case of necessity the halyards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
can be let go and the mast and sail unshipped and stowed below
with the greatest ease and expedition, leaving only the short lower
mast standing. A leg-of-mutton sail with a common boom along
the foot is shown in the cut as the most easily illustrated application
of the device, but there is no reason why it may not be applied
to a sail of different shape, with a
sprit instead of a boom, and a square
instead of a pointed head.</p>

<h3>The Latteen Rig</h3>

<div class="figright" style="width: 402px;"><a id="Fig_146"></a>
<img src="images/i_119.png" width="402" height="662" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 146.&mdash;The latteen rig.</div>
</div>

<div class='unindent'>is recommended only for boats which
are "stiff"&mdash;not tottlish, that is. The
fact that a considerable portion of the
sail projects forward of the mast renders
it awkward in case of a sudden shift of
wind. Its most convenient form is
shown in <a href="#Fig_146">Fig. 146</a>. The arrangement
for shipping and unshipping the yard is
precisely like that shown in <a href="#Fig_145">Fig. 145</a>&mdash;a
short lower mast with a pin at the top
and a ring fitted to the yard. It has a
boom at the foot which is joined to the
yard at C by means of a hook or a
simple lashing, having sufficient play to allow the two spars to
shut up together like a pair of dividers. The boom (C, E) has,
where it meets the short lower mast, a half-cleat, or jaw, shown in
detail at the bottom of the cut (<a href="#Fig_146">Fig. 146</a>), the circle representing a
cross-section of the mast. This should be lashed to the boom, as
screws or bolts would weaken it. To take in sail, the boatman brings
the boat to the wind, seizes the boom and draws it toward him.
This disengages it from the mast. He then shoves it forward, when
the yard (C, D) falls of its own weight into his hands and can be
at once lifted clear of the lower mast. To keep the sail flat, it is
possible to arrange a collar on the lower mast so that the boom,
when once in position, cannot slip upward and suffer the sail to bag.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>


<h3>The Cat-Rig</h3>

<div class='unindent'>so popular on the North Atlantic coast, is indicated in <a href="#Fig_148">Fig. 148</a>.
The spar at the head of the sail is called a "gaff," and, like the
boom, it fits the mast with semicircular jaws. The sail is hoisted
and lowered by means of halyards rove through a block near
the mast-head. The mast is set in the bows&mdash;"Chock up in the
eyes of her," as a sailor would say. A single leg-of-mutton sail will
not work in this position, because the greater part of its area is
too far forward of amidships. No rig is handier or safer than
this in working to windward; but off the wind&mdash;running before,
or nearly before it, that is&mdash;the weight of mast and sail, and the
pressure of the wind at one side and far forward, make the boat
very difficult and dangerous to steer. Prudent boatmen often
avoid doing so by keeping the wind on the quarter and, as it were,
tacking to leeward.</div>

<p>This suggests the question of "jibing," an operation always
to be avoided if possible. Suppose the wind to be astern, and the
boat running nearly before it, it becomes necessary to change
your course toward the side on which the sail is drawing. The
safest way is to turn at first in the opposite direction, put the helm
"down" (toward the sail), bring the boat up into the wind, turn
her entirely around, and stand off on the new tack. This, however,
is not always possible. Hauling in the sheet until the sail
fills on the other side is "jibing"; but when this happens it goes
over with a rush that sometimes carries mast and sheet or upsets
the boat; hence the operation should be first undertaken in a light
wind. It is necessary to know how to do it, for sometimes a sail
insists upon jibing very unexpectedly, and it is best to be prepared
for such emergencies.</p>


<h3>How to Make a Sail</h3>

<p>For the sails of small boats there is no better material than unbleached
twilled cotton sheeting. It is to be had two and a half
or even three yards wide. In cutting out your sail, let the selvage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
be at the "leech," or after-most edge. This, of course, makes it
necessary to cut the luff and foot "bias," and they are very likely
to stretch in the making, so that the sail will assume a different
shape from what was intended. To avoid this, baste the hem
carefully before sewing, and "hold in" a little to prevent fulling.
It is a good plan to tack the material on the floor before cutting,
and mark the outline of the sail with pencil. Stout tape stitched
along the bias edges will make a sure thing of it, and the material
can be cut, making due allowance for the hem. Better take
feminine advice on this process. The hems should be half an
inch deep all around, selvage and all, and it will do no harm to
reinforce them with cord if you wish to make a thoroughly good
piece of work.</p>

<p>For running-rigging, nothing is better than laid or braided
cotton cord, such as is used for awnings and sash-cords. If this
is not easily procured, any stout twine will answer. It can be
doubled and twisted as often as necessary. The smallest manila
rope is rather stiff and unmanageable for such light sails as ours.</p>

<p>In fitting out a boat of any kind, iron, unless galvanized, is
to be avoided as much as possible, on account of its liability to
rust. Use brass or copper instead.</p>


<h3>Hints to Beginners</h3>

<p>Nothing has been said about reefing thus far, because small
boats under the management of beginners should not be afloat
in a "reefing breeze." Reefing is the operation of reducing the
spread of sail when the wind becomes too fresh. If you will look
at <a href="#Fig_146">Fig. 146</a> you will see rows of short marks on the sail above the
boom. These are "reef-points"&mdash;bits of line about a foot long
passing through holes in the sail and knotted so that they will not
slip. In reefing, the sail is lowered and that portion of it between
the boom and the reef-points is gathered together, and the points
are tied around both it and the boom. When the lower row of points
is used it is a single reef. Both rows together are a double reef.</p>

<p>Make your first practical experiment <i>with a small sail and</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
<i>with the wind blowing toward the shore</i>. Row out a little way,
and then sail in any direction in which you can make the boat go,
straight back to shore if you can, with the sail out nearly at right
angles with the boat. Then try running along shore with the sheet
hauled in a little and the sail on the side nearest the shore. You
will soon learn what your craft can do, and will probably find that
she will make very little, if any, headway to windward. This is
partly because she slides sidewise over the water. To prevent it
you may use a "lee-board"&mdash;namely,
a broad board hung over
the side of the boat (G, <a href="#Fig_143">Fig. 143</a>).
This must be held by stout lines,
as the strain upon it is very heavy.
It should be placed a little forward
of the middle of the boat.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 496px;"><a id="Fig_147"></a>
<img src="images/i_122.png" width="496" height="312" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 147.&mdash;Making port.</div>
</div>

<p>It must be on the side away from
the wind&mdash;the lee side&mdash;and must
be shifted when you go about. Keels and centreboards are
permanent contrivances for the same purpose, but a lee-board
answers very well as a makeshift, and is even used habitually
by some canoeists and other boatmen.</p>

<p>In small boats it is sometimes desirable to sit amidships,
because sitting in the stern raises the bow too high out of water;
steering may be done with an oar over the lee side, or with "yoke-lines"
attached to a cross-piece on the rudder-head, or even to the
tiller. In this last case the lines must be rove through rings or
pulleys at the sides of the boat opposite the end of the tiller.
When the handle of the oar (H, <a href="#Fig_143">Fig. 143</a>)&mdash;or the tiller (F, <a href="#Fig_146">Fig.
146</a>) if a rudder is used&mdash;is pushed to the right, the boat will turn
to the left, and <i>vice versa</i>. The science of steering consists in
knowing when to push and how much to push&mdash;very simple, you
see, in the statement, but not always so easy in practice.</p>

<p>The sail should be so adjusted in relation to the rest of the
boat that, when the sheet is hauled close in and made fast, the
boat, if left to herself, will point her head to the wind like a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
weather-cock and drift slowly astern. If it is found that the
sail is so far forward that she will not do this, the fault may be
remedied by stepping the mast further aft or by rigging a small
sail near the stern. This is called a "dandy" or "steering sail,"
and is especially convenient in a boat whose size or arrangement
necessitates sitting amidships. It may be rigged like the mainsail,
and when its sheet is once made fast will ordinarily take care of
itself in tacking.</p>

<p>Remember that, if the wind freshens or a squall strikes you,
the position of safety is with the boat's head to the wind. When
in doubt what to do, push the helm down (toward the sail) and
haul in the slack of the sheet as the boat comes up into the wind.
If she is moving astern, or will not mind her helm&mdash;and of course
she will not if she is not moving&mdash;pull her head around to the wind
with an oar and experiment cautiously until you find which way
you can make her go.</p>

<p>In making a landing, always calculate to have the boat's
head as near the wind as possible when she ceases to move,
this whether you lower your sail or not.</p>

<p>Thus, if the wind is off shore, as shown at A, <a href="#Fig_147">Fig. 147</a>, land
at F or G, with the bow toward the shore. If the wind is from the
direction of B, land at E, with the bow toward B or at F; if at the
latter, the boom will swing away from the wharf and permit you
to lie alongside. If the wind is from D, reverse these positions.
If the wind comes from the direction of C, land either at F or G,
with the bow pointing off shore.</p>

<p>If you have no one to tell you what to do, you will have to
feel your way slowly and learn by experience; but if you have
nautical instincts you will soon make your boat do what you wish
her to do as far as she is able. <i>But first learn to swim before you
try to sail a boat.</i></p>

<p>Volumes have been written on the subject treated in these few
pages, and it is not yet exhausted. The hints here given are safe
ones to follow, and will, it is hoped, be of service to many a young
sailor in many a corner of the world.</p>

<small>MORE RIGS OF ALL KINDS FOR SMALL BOATS</small></h2>

<div class='summary1'>How to Distinguish between a Ship, Bark, Brig, and Schooner&mdash;Merits
and Defects of Catboats&mdash;Advantages of the Sloop&mdash;Rigs
for Canoes&mdash;Buckeyes and Sharpies</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> two principal rigs for vessels are the fore-and-aft and the
square rig.</p>

<p><b>Square rigged</b> consists in having the principal sails extended by
yards suspended at the middle (<a href="#Fig_159">Fig. 159</a>).</p>

<p><b>Fore-and-aft rigged</b> is having the principal sails extended by
booms and gaffs suspended by their ends (<a href="#Fig_148">Figs. 148</a>, <a href="#Fig_149">149</a>, <a href="#Fig_150">150</a>,
<a href="#Fig_156">156</a>, and <a href="#Fig_161">161</a>).</p>

<p>Barks, brigs, and ships are all more or less square rigged, but
schooners, sloops, and catboats are all fore-and-aft rigged. In
these notes the larger forms of boats are mentioned only because
of the well-known interest boys take in all nautical matters, but
no detailed description of the larger craft will be given. All that
is aimed at here is to give the salient points, so that the youngsters
will know the name of the rig when they see it.</p>


<h3>The Cat</h3>

<p>There is a little snub-nosed American who, in spite of her short
body and broad waist, is deservedly popular among all our
amateur sailors.</p>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="drawings">

</div></td></tr>
</table></div>



<p>The appreciation of her charms is felt and acknowledged by
all her companions without envy, not because of her saucy looks,
but on account of her accommodating manners.</p>

<p>Possessing a rare ability for quick movement, and a wonderful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
power to bore her way almost into the very eye of the wind, or
with double-reefed sail to dash through the storm or gently slide
up alongside of a wharf or dock as easily as a rowboat, the American
catboat, with her single mast "chock up in the eyes of her,"
has made a permanent place for herself among our pleasure craft,
and is omnipresent in our crowded bays and harbors.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 427px;"><a id="Fig_150"></a>
<img src="images/i_125c.png" width="427" height="274" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 150.&mdash;Schooner rig for open boat.
Boom on mainsail, none on foresail.</div>
</div>

<p>Knowing that there is little danger of the catboat losing its
well-earned popularity, and being somewhat familiar with many
of her peculiarities, I am free to say that this rig, notwithstanding
its numerous good points, has many serious defects as a school-ship,
and the beginner had better select some other rig with which
to begin his practice sailing.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 254px;"><a id="Fig_151"></a>

<p>First, the great sail is very heavy and difficult to hoist and reef.
Second, in going before the wind there is constant danger of jibing,
with serious results. Third, the catboat has a very bad habit
of rolling when sailing before the wind, and each time the boat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
rolls from side to side she is liable to dip the end of her heavy
boom in the water and "trip herself up." When a boat trips <i>up</i>
she does not necessarily go <i>down</i>, but she is likely to upset, placing
the young sailors in an unenviable, if not a dangerous, position.
Fourth, when the craft begins to swagger before the wind she is
liable to "goose-neck"; that is, throw her boom up against the
mast, which is another accident fraught with the possibilities of
serious mischief.</p>

<p>The catboat has no bowsprit, no jib, and no topsail (<a href="#Fig_148">Fig. 148</a>),
but that most graceful of all single-stickers,</p>


<h3>The Sloop</h3>

<div class='unindent'>possesses several jibs, a bowsprit, and topsail. Besides these,
when she is in racing trim, a number of additional sails are used.
All our great racers are sloops, and this rig is the most convenient
for small yachts and cutters.</div>

<h3>Jib and Mainsail</h3>

<p>A small sloop's sails are a mainsail, jib, and topsail. A sloop
rig without topsail is called a jib and mainsail (<a href="#Fig_149">Fig. 149</a>).</p>

<p>While every small-boat sailor should know a catboat and a
sloop when he sees them, and even be able to give the proper name
to their sails, neither of these rigs is very well suited for canoes,
sharpies, or other boats of the mosquito fleet; but the</p>


<h3>Schooner Rig</h3>



<div class='unindent'>which is the form of boat generally used for the larger yachts,
is also very much used for open boats. As you can see, by referring
to <a href="#Fig_150">Fig. 150</a>, the schooner rig consists of a bowsprit, fore and
main mast, with their appropriate sails. Lately freight schooners
have appeared with four or more masts. For small boats two
adjustable masts and an adjustable bowsprit, as described in the

sail is depicted and fully described.</p>


<h3>The Balance Lug</h3>

<div class='unindent'>comes as near the square sail of a ship as any canvas used on
small boats, but you can see, by referring to the diagram, <a href="#Fig_151">Fig. 151</a>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
that the leach and the luff are not parallel and that the gaff hangs
at an angle. To boom out the canvas and make it sit flat there
are three sticks extended across the sail from the front to the
back, luff to leach, called battens. This has caused some people
to call this a batten lug. Like the lateen sail, part of the balance
lug hangs before the mast and serves the purpose of a jib. This
rig is said to be easily managed and to possess good sailing qualities.</div>

<div class="caption">Showing detail of sprit club sail.</div>
</div>


<h3>The Standing Lug</h3>

<div class='unindent'>is another sail approaching the square in pattern (<a href="#Fig_152">Fig. 152</a>), and,
as any novice can see, is a good canvas with which to scud before
the wind. It is very convenient for open boats built to be propelled
by paddles. While the standing lug cannot point up to the
eye of the wind like a schooner or cat, it is very fast on the wind
or when running with the wind astern. Probably the safest form
of sail used is the old reliable</div>


<h3>Leg-of-Mutton Sail</h3>

<p>This is used by the fishermen on their stanch little dories away
up on the coast of Maine, and by the "tide-water" people in their
"buckeyes" on Chesapeake Bay. The latter boat is very little
known outside of the locality where it makes its home, but, like
the New Haven sharpies, it is very popular in its own waters.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>


<h3>The Buckeye</h3>

<div class='unindent'>or "bugeye," as it is sometimes vulgarly called, has a great reputation
for speed and sea-going qualities. When it cannot climb
a wave it goes through it. This makes a wet boat in heavy
weather, but when you travel at a high rate of speed you can endure
a wet jacket with no complaint, especially when you feel
that, in spite of the fast-sailing qualities of this boat, it is considered
a particularly safe craft.</div>

<div class="caption">Another form of the sprit sail.</div>
</div>

<p>The construction of a <b>buckeye</b> (<a href="#Fig_162">Fig. 162</a>) has been evolved from
the old dugout canoe of the Indians and the first white settlers.
America was originally covered with vast forests of immense trees.
Remnants of these forests still exist in a few localities. It was
once possible to make a canoe of almost any dimensions desired,
but now in the thickly settled regions big trees are scarce.</p>

<p>So the Chesapeake Bay boat-builders, while still adhering to the
old dugout, have overcome the disadvantage of small logs by
using more than one and bolting the pieces together. Masts and
sails have been added, and since the increased proportions made
it impracticable to drag such a craft on the beach when in port,
anchors and cables are supplied. Two holes bored, one on each
side of the stem, for the cables to run through, have given the
boat the appearance of having eyes, and as the eyes are large and
round, the negroes called them buckeyes, and this is now the
name by which all such craft are known.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>At first only two masts with leg-of-mutton sails were used, but
now they have a jib and two sails. With the greatest width or
beam about one-third the distance from bow to stern, sharp at
both ends, its long, narrow, and heavy hull is easily driven through
the water and makes both a fast and stiff boat.</p>

<p>The buckeye travels in shallow as well as deep waters, and
hence is a centreboard boat, but there is nothing unnecessary on
the real buckeye&mdash;no overhanging bow or stern, for that means
additional labor; no stays to the masts, for the same reason. The
lack of stays to stiffen the masts leaves them with "springiness,"
which in case of a sudden squall helps to spill the wind and prevents
what might otherwise be a "knock-down."</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 170.&mdash;Lug rig with jigger.</div>
</div>



<p>The foremast is longer than the mainmast and does not rake
aft so much, but the mainmast has a decided rake, which the colored
sailors say makes the boat faster on the wind. Sometimes
in the smaller boats the mainmast can be set upright when going
before the wind.</p>

</div>
<p>Wealthy gentlemen on the Chesapeake are now building regularly
equipped yachts on the buckeye plan, and some of them
are quite large boats. A correspondent of the <i>Forest and Stream</i>,
in speaking of the buckeye, says:</p>

<p>"Last summer I cruised in company with a buckeye, forty-two
feet long, manned by two gentlemen of Baltimore city. She drew
twenty inches without the board. In sudden and heavy flaws she
was rarely luffed. She would lie over and appear to spill the wind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
out of her tall, sharp sails and then right again. Her crew took
pleasure in tackling every sailing craft for a race; nothing under
seventy feet in length ever beat her. She steered under any two
of her three sails. On one occasion this craft, on her way from
Cape May to Cape Charles, was driven out to sea before a heavy
north-west blow. Her crew, the aforesaid gentlemen, worn out by
fatigue, hove her to and went to sleep. She broke her tiller lashing
during the night, and when they awoke she was pegging away
on a south-east course under her jib. They put her about, and in
twenty hours were inside Cape Henry, pretty well tired out. Buckeyes
frequently run from Norfolk to New York with fruit. For
shallow waters, I am satisfied there is no better craft afloat.
Built deep, with a loaded keel, they would rival the English cutter
in seaworthiness and speed."</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 173.&mdash;Sprit sail, schooner rig, with dandy.</div>
</div>

<p>When the hardy, bold fishermen of our Eastern States and the
brave fishermen down South both use the leg-of-mutton sail,
beginners cannot object to using it while practising; knowing that
even if it is a safe sail, it cannot be called a "baby rig." Another
safe rig, differing little from the leg-of-mutton, is the</p>


<h3>Sliding Gunter</h3>

<p>In this rig the sail is laced to a yard which slides up or down
the mast by means of two iron hooks or travellers (<a href="#Fig_163">Fig. 163</a>). No
sail with a narrow-pointed top is very serviceable before the wind,
and the sliding gunter is no exception to the rule. But it is useful
on the wind, and can be reefed easily and quickly, qualities which
make it many friends.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>In the smooth, shallow waters along the coast of North Carolina
may be seen the long, flat-bottomed</p>


<h3>Sharpies</h3>

<p>Without question they are to be ranked among the fastest boats
we have. These boats are rigged with a modification of the leg-of-mutton
sail. The ends of the sprit in the foresail project at the
luff and leach. At the luff it is fastened to the mast by a line like
a snotter at the leach. It is fastened to a stick sewed into the sail,
called a club. The sheet is attached to the end of the sprit
(Figs. 164-168).</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 174.&mdash;Sprit sail jib and dandy.</div>
</div>




<h3>The Sprit Leg-of-Mutton Sail</h3>

<div class='unindent'>has this advantage, that the clew of the sail is much higher than
the tack, thus avoiding the danger of dipping the clew in the water
and tripping the boat.</div>

</div>

<h3>The Dandy Jigger, or Mizzen Rig</h3>

<div class='unindent'>is named after the small sail aft, near the rudder-head. This
jigger, mizzen, or dandy may have a boom, a sprit, or be rigged
as a lug. (See <a href="#Fig_170">Figs. 170</a>, <a href="#Fig_171">171</a>, <a href="#Fig_173">173</a>, <a href="#Fig_174">174</a>, <a href="#Fig_175">175</a>, <a href="#Fig_178">178</a>, <a href="#Fig_180">180</a>, and <a href="#Fig_184">184</a>,

image, click <a href="images/i_134-big.png">here</a>.]</div></div>
<p>In puffy wind and lumpy water the main and mizzen rig will
be found to work well. The little sail aft should be trimmed as
flat as possible. It will be found of great help in beating to the
windward, and will keep the nose of the boat facing the wind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a><br /><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
when the mainsail is down. Different rigs are popular in different
localities. For instance:</p>


<h3>The Lateen Rig</h3>

<div class='unindent'>is very popular in some parts of the Old World, yet it has only
few friends here. It may be because of my art training that I feel
so kindly toward this style of sail, or it may be from association in
my mind of some of the happiest days of my life with a little black
canoe rigged with lateen sails. At any rate, in spite of the undeniable
fact that the lateen is unpopular, I never see a small boat
rigged in this style without a feeling of pleasure. The handy little
stumps of masts end in a spike at the top and are adorned by
the beautiful sails lashed to slender spars, which, by means of
metal rings, are lightly, but securely, fastened to the mast by
simply hooking the ring over the spike. I freely acknowledge that
when the sails are lowered and you want to use your paddle the
lateen sails are in your way. It is claimed that they are awkward
to reef, and this may be true. I never tried it. When the wind
was too strong for my sails I made port or took in either the large
or the small sail, as the occasion seemed to demand.</div>


<h3>The Ship</h3>

<p>When you are out sailing and see a vessel with three masts, all
square rigged, you are looking at a ship proper, though ship is a
word often used loosely for any sort of a boat (<a href="#Fig_159">Fig. 159</a>).</p>

<p><b>The bark</b> is a vessel with square-rigged foremast and mainmast
and a fore-and-aft rigged mizzen-mast (<a href="#Fig_160">Fig. 160</a>).</p>

<p><b>The brig</b> is a vessel with only two masts, both of which are
square rigged (<a href="#Fig_158">Fig. 158</a>).</p>

<p><b>The brigantine</b> has two masts&mdash;foremast square rigged and
mainmast fore-and-aft rigged (<a href="#Fig_155">Fig. 155</a>).</p>

<p><b>The barkentine</b> has three masts&mdash;mainmast and mizzen-mast
fore-and-aft rigged and foremast square rigged. (See <a href="#Fig_154">Fig. 154</a>.)</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI<br />
<small>KNOTS, BENDS, AND HITCHES</small></h2>


<div class='summary2'>How to Tie Knots Useful on Both Land and Water</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> art of tying knots is an almost necessary adjunct to not a
few recreations. Especially is this true of summer sports, many
of which are nautical or in some manner connected with the water.</p>

<p>Any boy who has been aboard a yacht or a sail-boat must have
realized that the safety of the vessel and all aboard may be imperilled
by ignorance or negligence in the tying of a knot or fastening
of a rope.</p>

<p>With some the knack of tying a good, strong knot in a heavy
rope or light cord seems to be a natural gift; it is certainly a very
convenient accomplishment, and one that with practice and a
little perseverance may be acquired even by those who at first
make the most awkward and bungling attempts.</p>

<p>A bulky, cumbersome knot is not only ungainly, but is generally
insecure.</p>

<p>As a rule, the strength of a knot is in direct proportion to its neat
and handsome appearance.</p>

<p>To my mind it is as necessary that the archer should know how
to make the proper loops at the end of his bow-string as it is that
a hunter should understand how to load his gun.</p>

<p>Every fisherman should be able to join two lines neatly and securely,
and should know the best and most expeditious method
of attaching an extra hook or fly; and any boy who rigs up a hammock
or swing with a "granny" or other insecure knot deserves
the ugly tumble and sore bones that are more than liable to result
from his ignorance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>A knot, nautically speaking, is a "bend" that is more permanent
than a "hitch." A knot properly tied never slips, nor
does it jam so that it cannot be readily untied. A "hitch" might
be termed a temporary bend, as it is seldom relied upon for permanent
service. The "hitch" is so made that it can be cast off
or unfastened more quickly than a knot.</p>

<p>It is impossible for the brightest boy to learn to make "knots,
bends, and hitches" by simply reading over a description of the
methods; for, although he may understand them at the time,
five minutes after reading the article the process will have escaped
his memory. But if he take a piece of cord or rope and sit down
with the diagrams in front of him, he will find little difficulty in
managing the most complicated knots; and he will not only acquire
an accomplishment from which he can derive infinite amusement
for himself and a means of entertainment for others, but the
knowledge gained may, in case of accident by fire or flood, be the
means of saving both life and property.</p>

<p>The accompanying diagrams show a number of useful and
important bends, splices, etc. To simplify matters, let us commence
with <a href="#Fig_57">Fig. 57</a>, and go through the diagrams in the order in
which they come:</p>

<p>The "English" or "common single fisherman's knot" (<a href="#Fig_185">Fig.
185</a>, I) is neat and strong enough for any ordinary strain. The
diagram shows the knots before being tightened and drawn together.</p>

<p>When exceptional strength is required it can be obtained by
joining the lines in the ordinary single fisherman's knot (<a href="#Fig_185">Fig. 185</a>, I)
and pulling each of the half knots as tight as possible, then drawing
them within an eighth of an inch of each other and wrapping
between with fine gut that has been previously softened in water,
or with light-colored silk.</p>

<p>An additional line or a sinker may be attached by tying a knot
in the end of the extra line and inserting it between the parts of
the single fisherman's knot before they are drawn together and
tightened.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><a id="Fig_185"></a>

<div class="caption">Fig. 185.&mdash;Some useful knots.</div>
</div>

<p>The "fisherman's double half knot," <a href="#Fig_185">Fig. 185</a> (II and III).
After the gut has been passed around the main line and through
itself, it is passed around the line once more and through the same
loop again and drawn close.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p><a href="#Fig_185">Fig. 185</a> (IV, V, and IX). Here are three methods of joining
the ends of two lines together; the diagrams explain them
much better than words can. Take a piece of string, try each
one, and test their relative strength.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig_185">Fig. 185</a> (VI). It often happens, while fishing, that a hook is
caught in a snag or by some other means lost. The diagram
shows the most expeditious manner of attaching another hook
by what is known as the "sinker hitch," described further on
(<a href="#Fig_185">Fig. 185</a>, D, D, D, and <a href="#Fig_186">Fig. 186</a>, XIV, XV, and XVI).</p>

<p><a href="#Fig_185">Fig. 185</a>, VII is another and more secure method of attaching
a hook by knitting the line on with a succession of half-hitches.</p>


<h3>How to Make a Horse-Hair Watch-Guard</h3>

<p>The same hitches are used in the manufacture of horse-hair
watch-guards, much in vogue with the boys in some sections of
the country. As regularly as "kite-time," "top-time," or "ball-time,"
comes "horse-hair watch-guard time."</p>

<p>About once a year the rage for making watch-guards used to
seize the boys of our school, and by some means or other almost
every boy would have a supply of horse-hair on hand. With the
first tap of the bell for recess, some fifty hands would dive into
the mysterious depths of about fifty pockets, and before the bell
had stopped ringing about fifty watch-guards, in a more or less incomplete
state, would be produced.</p>

<p>Whenever a teamster's unlucky stars caused him to stop near
the school-house, a chorus of voices greeted him with "Mister,
please let us have some hair from your horses' tails."</p>

<p>The request was at first seldom refused, possibly because its
nature was not at the time properly understood; but lucky was
the boy considered who succeeded in pulling a supply of hair
from the horses' tails without being interrupted by the heels of
the animals or by the teamster, who, when he saw the swarm of
boys tugging at his horses' tails, generally repented his first good-natured
assent, and with a gruff, "Get out, you young rascals!"
sent the lads scampering to the school-yard fence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>Select a lot of long hair of the color desired; make it into a
switch about an eighth of an inch thick by tying one end in a
simple knot. Pick out a good, long hair and tie it around the
switch close to the knotted end; then take the free end of the single
hair in your right hand and pass it under the switch on one side,
thus forming a loop through which the end of the hair must pass
after it is brought up and over from the other side of the switch.
Draw the knot tight by pulling the free end of the hair as shown
by <a href="#Fig_185">Fig. 185</a>, VII. Every time this operation is repeated a wrap
and a knot is produced. The knots follow each other in a spiral
around the switch, giving it a very pretty, ornamented appearance.
When one hair is used up select another and commence knitting
with it as you did with the first, being careful to cover and conceal
the short end of the first hair, and to make the knots on the second
commence where the former stop. A guard made of white
horse-hair looks as if it might be composed of spun glass, and produces
a very odd and pretty effect. A black one is very genteel
in appearance. These ornaments are much prized by cowboys,
and I have seen bridles for horses made of braided horsehair.</p>


<h3>Miscellaneous</h3>

<p><a href="#Fig_185">Fig. 185</a>, VIII shows a simple and expeditous manner of attaching
a trolling-hook to a fish-line.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig_185">Fig. 185</a>, F is a hitch used on shipboard, or wherever lines
and cables are used. It is called the Blackwall hitch.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig_185">Fig. 185</a>, E is a fire-escape made of a double bow-line knot,
useful as a sling for hoisting persons up or letting them down from
any high place; the window of a burning building, for instance.
<a href="#Fig_186">Fig. 186</a>, XVIII, XIX, and XX show how this knot is made. It
is described on <a href="#Page_77">page 77</a>.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig_185">Fig. 185</a>, A is a "bale hitch," made of a loop of rope. To make
it, take a piece of rope that has its two ends joined; lay the rope
down and place the bale on it; bring the loop opposite you up, on
that side of the bale, and the loop in front up, on the side of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
bale next to you; thrust the latter loop under and through the first
and attach the hoisting rope. The heavier the object to be lifted,
the tighter the hitch becomes. An excellent substitute for a shawl-strap
can be made of a cord by using the bale hitch, the loop at
the top being a first-rate handle.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig_185">Fig. 185</a>, B is called a cask sling, and C (<a href="#Fig_185">Fig. 185</a>) is called a
butt sling. The manner of making these last two and their uses
may be seen by referring to the illustration. It will be noticed
that a line is attached to the bale hitch in a peculiar manner
(<i>a</i>, <a href="#Fig_185">Fig. 185</a>). This is called the "anchor bend." If while
aboard a sail-boat you have occasion to throw a bucket over for
water, you will find the anchor bend a very convenient and safe
way to attach a line to the bucket handle, but unless you are an
expert you will need an anchor hitched to your body or you will
follow the bucket.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig_186">Fig. 186</a>, I and II are loops showing the elements of the simplest
knots.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig_186">Fig. 186</a>, III is a simple knot commenced.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig_186">Fig. 186</a>, IV shows the simple knot tightened.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig_186">Fig. 186</a>, V and VI show how the Flemish knot looks when
commenced and finished.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig_186">Fig. 186</a>, VII and VIII show a "rope knot" commenced and
finished.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig_186">Fig. 186</a>, IX is a double knot commenced.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig_186">Fig. 186</a>, X is the same completed.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig_186">Fig. 186</a>, XI shows a back view of the double knot.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig_186">Fig. 186</a>, XII is the first loop of a "bow-line knot." One end
of the line is supposed to be made fast to some object. After the
turn, or loop (<a href="#Fig_186">Fig. 186</a>, XII), is made, hold it in position with your
left hand and pass the end of the line up through the loop, or turn,
you have just made, behind and over the line above, then down
through the loop again, as shown in the diagram (<a href="#Fig_186">Fig. 186</a>, XIII);
pull it tight and the knot is complete. The "sinker hitch" is a
very handy one to know, and the variety of uses it may be put to
will be at once suggested by the diagrams.</p>

<p>Lines that have both ends made fast may have weights attached
to them by means of the sinker hitch (<a href="#Fig_185">Fig. 185</a>, D, D, D).</p>

<p>To accomplish this, first gather up some slack and make it in
the form of the loop (<a href="#Fig_186">Fig. 186</a>, XIV); bend the loop back on itself
(<a href="#Fig_186">Fig. 186</a>, XV) and slip the weight through the double loop thus
formed (<a href="#Fig_186">Fig. 186</a>, XVI); draw tight by pulling the two top lines,
and the sinker hitch is finished (<a href="#Fig_186">Fig. 186</a>, XVII).</p>

<p>The "fire-escape sling" previously mentioned, and illustrated
by <a href="#Fig_185">Fig. 185</a>, E, is made with a double line.</p>

<p>Proceed at first as you would to make a simple bow-line knot
(<a href="#Fig_186">Fig. 186</a>, XVIII).</p>

<p>After you have run the end loop up through the turn (<a href="#Fig_186">Fig. 186</a>,
XIX), bend it downward and over the bottom loop and turn, then
up again until it is in the position shown in <a href="#Fig_186">Fig. 186</a>, XX; pull it
downward until the knot is tightened, as in <a href="#Fig_185">Fig. 185</a>, E, and it
makes a safe sling in which to lower a person from any height.
The longer loop serves for a seat, and the shorter one, coming
under the arms, makes a rest for the back.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig_186_5">Fig. 186½</a>, XXI is called a "boat knot," and is made with the
aid of a stick. It is an excellent knot for holding weights which
may want instant detachment. To detach it, lift the weight
slightly and push out the stick, and instantly the knot is untied.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig_186_5">Fig. 186½</a>, XXII. Commencement of a "six-fold knot."</p>

<p><a href="#Fig_186_5">Fig. 186½</a>, XXIII. Six-fold knot completed by drawing the

<p><a href="#Fig_186_5">Fig. 186½</a>, XXXI. The right-hand part of the rope shows how
to make the double loop for the "twist knot." The left-hand
part of the same rope shows a finished twist knot. It is made
by taking a half turn on both the right-hand and left-hand lines
of the double loop and passing the end through the "bight"
(loop) so made.</p>


<h3>Whiplashes</h3>

<p><a href="#Fig_186_5">Fig. 186½</a>, XXXII is called the "chain knot," which is often
used in braiding leather whiplashes. To make a "chain knot,"
fasten one end of the thong, or line; make a simple loop and pass
it over the left hand; retain hold of the free end with the right
hand; with the left hand seize the line above the right hand and
draw a loop through the loop already formed; finish the knot by
drawing it tight with the left hand. Repeat the operation until the
braid is of the required length, then secure it by passing the free
end through the last loop.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig_186_5">Fig. 186½</a>, XXXIII shows a double chain knot.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig_186_5">Fig. 186½</a>, XXXIV is a double chain knot pulled out. It shows
how the free end is thrust through the last loop.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig_186_5">Fig. 186½</a>, XXXV. Knotted loop for end of rope, used to prevent
the end of the rope from slipping, and for various other
purposes.</p>


<h3>Splices, Timber-Hitches, etc.</h3>

<p>Although splices may not be as useful to boys as knots and
hitches, for the benefit of those among my readers who are interested
in the subject, I have introduced a few bands and splices
on the cables partly surrounding <a href="#Fig_186">Fig. 186</a>½.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig_186_5">Fig. 186½</a>, <i>a</i> shows the knot and upper side of a "simple band."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII<br />
<small>HOW TO BUILD A CHEAP BOAT</small></h2>


<h3>The Yankee Pine</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">From</span> the saw-mills away up among the tributaries of the Ohio
River come floating down to the towns along the shore great
rafts of pine lumber. These rafts are always objects of interest
to the boys, for the youngsters know that when moored to the
shore the solidly packed planks make a splendid platform to
swim from. Fine springing-boards can be made of the projecting
blades of the gigantic sweeps which are used to guide the
mammoth rafts, and, somewhere aboard, there is always to be
found a "Yankee pine." Just when or why this style of skiff
was dubbed with such a peculiar name I am unable to state;
but this I know, that when a raft is to be broken up and carted
away to the lumber yards there is, or always used to be, a good,
light skiff to be had cheap.</p>

<p>However, all boys do not live on the bank of the river, and if
they did there would hardly be "Yankee pines" enough to go
round; so we will at once proceed to see how to build one for ourselves.
Although my readers may find the "Yankee pine" a little
more difficult to build than the blunt-ended, flat-bottomed scow,
it really is a comparatively simple piece of work for boys familiar
with the use of carpenters' tools.</p>

<p>For the side-pieces select two straight-grained pine boards free
from knots. These boards should be about 13 or 14 feet long,
a couple of inches over a foot in width, and as nearly alike as
possible in texture. Besides these there should be in the neighborhood
of a dozen other ¾-inch planks, an inch or two over a half<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
foot in width. A small piece of 2-inch plank for the stern-piece is
also necessary. Upon the bottom edge of the side-board measure
off from each end toward the centre 4 inches, mark the points, and
saw off the corners shown by the dotted line in <a href="#Fig_188">Fig. 188</a>. Next
take a piece of board 4 feet long and a foot wide, saw off the corners
as you did on the side-board, making it 4 feet on the top and
3 feet 4 inches on the bottom. This board is to be used only as
a centre brace while modelling the boat.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 390px;"><a id="Fig_188"></a>

<img src="images/i_153b.png" width="518" height="155" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 189.&mdash;Frame.</div>
</div>

<p>Out of the 2-inch plank make a stern-piece of the same shape
as the centre brace; let it be 1 foot wide, 14 inches long on the
bottom, and 20 inches long on top. Set the side-boards on their
shorter or bottom edges and place the centre brace in the middle,
as shown by <a href="#Fig_189">Fig. 189</a>; nail the side-boards to it, using only enough
nails to hold temporarily. Draw the side-boards together at the
bow and against the stern-board at the stern (<a href="#Fig_189">Fig. 189</a>). Hold the
side-pieces in position by the means of ropes. A stem should be
ready to fix in the bow (<a href="#Fig_190">Fig. 190</a>). This had better be a few inches
longer than the sides are broad, as it is a simple matter to saw off
the top after it is fitted. Make the stem of a triangular piece of
timber, by planing off the front edge until a flat surface about
½ inch broad is obtained; 2 inches from the front, upon each side,
cut a groove just the thickness of the side-boards (¾ inch). Trim<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
the stem so that the side-pieces at the bow fit the grooves snugly,
and nail the side-boards to the stem and to the stern-piece (<a href="#Fig_189">Fig.
189</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a id="Fig_190"></a>

<div class="caption">Fig. 191.&mdash;Finished skiff.</div>
</div>

<p>Turn the boat upside down, and it will be discovered that the
outlines of the bottom form an arch from stem to stern. If left
in this shape the boat will sink
too deep amidship. Remedy
the defect by planing the bottom
edge of both side pieces,
reducing the convex form to
straight lines in the middle. This will allow the bow and stern
to sheer, but at the same time will make the central part of
the bottom flat, and, by having less to drag through the water,
make it easier to row. Nail the bottom-boards on crosswise,
and as, on account of the form of the boat, no two boards will be
of the same size, they must be first nailed on and the projecting
ends sawed off afterward. The centre brace may now be taken
out and a long bottom-board nailed to the centre of the bottom
upon the inside of the boat (<a href="#Fig_191">Fig. 191</a>). Cut a small cross-piece
(B, <a href="#Fig_191">Fig. 191</a>) so that it will fit across the bow 3 inches below the
top of the side-boards. Nail it in place, driving the nails from the
outside of the side-board through and into the end of the stick B.
Saw out a bow seat, and, allowing the broad end to rest on the
cross-stick B, fit the seat in and secure it with nails (<a href="#Fig_191">Fig. 191</a>);<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
3 inches below the top of the stern-piece nail a cleat across. At
the same distance below the side-board put a cross-stick similar
to the one in the bow. This and the cleat on the stern-piece form
rests for the stern seat. Five feet from the stern saw a notch
2 inches deep and 1½ inch long in
each side-board (A, A<sup>1</sup>, <a href="#Fig_191">Fig. 191</a>).
Saw two more notches of the same
size 3 inches from the first; these
will make the rowlock when the
side strips have been fastened on.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 459px;"><a id="Fig_192"></a>
<img src="images/i_155a.png" width="459" height="166" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 192.&mdash;Keel board or skeg.</div>
</div>

<p>These strips should each be made of 1-inch plank, 2 inches
wide and an inch or two longer than the side-boards. Nail the
strips on the outside of the boat flush with the top of the side-boards,
making a neat joint at the stern-piece, as shown in the illustration
(<a href="#Fig_191">Fig. 191</a>). Cut two short strips to fit upon the inside at
the rowlocks and fasten them firmly on with screws (<a href="#Fig_191">Fig. 191</a>, A).
Next cut two cleats for the oarsman's seat to rest upon. Nail
them to the side-boards amidship a little nearer the bottom than
the top, so that the seat, when resting upon the cleats, will be
about half the distance from the top edge to the bottom of the
side-boards. Let the aft end of the cleats be about 6 feet 2 inches
from the stern. Make thole-pins of some hard wood to fit in the
rowlocks, like those described
and illustrated
by <a href="#Fig_203">Figs. 203</a> and <a href="#Fig_204">204</a>.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 193.&mdash;The side-boards.</div>
</div>
<p>The Yankee pine now
only needs a skeg to
complete it. This must
be placed exactly in the
centre, and is fastened
on by a couple of screws at the thin end and nails from the inside
of the boat. It is also fastened to the upright stick at the
stern by screws (<a href="#Fig_192">Fig. 192</a>).</p>

<p>If the joints have been carefully made, your Yankee pine is
now ready for launching. Being made of rough lumber it needs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
no paint or varnish, but is a sort of rough-and-ready affair, light
to row; and it ought to float four people with ease. By using
planed pine or cedar lumber, and
with hard-wood stem and stern,
a very pretty row-boat can be
made upon the same plan as a
Yankee pine, or by putting in
a centreboard and "stepping" a
mast in the bow, the Yankee
pine can be transformed into a
sail-boat. But before experimenting
in this line of boat-building,
the beginner had better read
carefully the chapter on how to
rig and sail small boats.</p>




<h3>How to Build a Better Finished
Boat</h3>

<p>The old-time raftsmen formerly
built their "Yankee pines"
of the rough, unplaned boards
fresh from the saw-mills on the
river banks, and these raw,
wooden skiffs were stanch, light,
and tight boats, but to-day
smooth lumber is as cheap as
the rough boards, so select
enough planed pine lumber for
a 12½-foot boat, and you may
calculate the exact amount by reference to the accompanying
diagrams, which are all drawn as near as may be to a regular
scale.</p>

<p>By reference to <a href="#Fig_193">Fig. 193</a> you will see that A, A represent
the two</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>


<h3>Side-Boards</h3>

<div class='unindent'>These should be of sufficient dimensions to produce two side-pieces
each 13 feet long, 17 inches wide, and <small><sup>7</sup>/<sub>8</sub></small> inch thick (A, <a href="#Fig_194">Fig.
194</a>). You will also need a piece for a</div>


<h3>Spreader</h3>

<div class='unindent'>54 inches long, 18 inches wide, and about 1½ inch thick, but
as this is a temporary affair almost any old piece of proper dimensions
will answer (B, <a href="#Fig_194">Fig. 194</a>), and another piece of good 1½-inch
plank (C, <a href="#Fig_194">Fig. 194</a>) 36 inches long by 15 inches wide, for a stern-piece.
Besides the above there must be enough 1-inch lumber to
make seats and to cover the bottom. At a point on one end,
6½ inches from the edge of the A plank, mark the point <i>c</i> (<a href="#Fig_194">Fig. 194</a>),
then measure 37 inches back along the edge of the plank and mark
the point <i>b</i> (<a href="#Fig_194">Fig. 194</a>). Rule a pencil line (<i>b</i>, <i>c</i>) between these two
points and starting at <i>c</i> saw off the triangle <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, <i>d</i>. Make the second
side-board an exact duplicate of the one just described and
prepare the spreader by sawing off the triangle with 9-inch bases
at each end of B (<a href="#Fig_194">Fig. 194</a>). This will leave you a board (<i>h</i>, <i>k</i>, <i>o</i>, <i>n</i>)
that will be 36 inches long on its lower edge and 54 inches long on
its top edge.</div>

<p>Next saw off the corners of the stern-piece C (<a href="#Fig_194">Fig. 194</a>) along<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
the lines <i>f</i>, <i>g</i>, the <i>g</i> points being each 6½ inches from the corners;
and a board (<i>ff</i>, <i>gg</i>) 18 inches wide and 30 inches top measurement,
with 23 inches at the bottom. Now fit the edge of the
stern-piece along the line <i>e</i>, <i>d</i> (<a href="#Fig_194">Fig. 194</a>), or at a slant to please your
fancy. In <a href="#Fig_195">Fig. 195</a>, upper C, the slant makes the base of the
triangle about 4½ inches, which is sufficient. Be careful that both
side-boards are fitted exactly alike, and to do this nail the port
side with nails driven only partly in, as shown at D (<a href="#Fig_195">Fig. 195</a>);
then nail the starboard side and, if they are both seen to be even
and of the right slant, drive the nails home; if not correct, the
nails may be pulled out by using a small block under the hammer
(D, <a href="#Fig_195">Fig. 195</a>), without bending the nails or injuring the wood.
Leave the stern-ends of the side-boards protruding, as in the
upper C, until you have the spreader and stem in place.</p>

<p>We are now ready for the spreader (<i>h</i>, <i>k</i>, <i>o</i>, <i>n</i>) (B, <a href="#Fig_194">Fig. 194</a>)
amidship, or, more accurately speaking, 6 feet 9 inches from
the bow (B, <a href="#Fig_195">Fig. 195</a>). Nail this as shown by D (<a href="#Fig_195">Fig. 195</a>), so
that the nails may be removed at pleasure. Bring the bow ends
of the A boards together and secure them by a strip nailed temporarily
across, as shown in the diagram E (<a href="#Fig_195">Fig. 195</a>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>


<h3>The Stem-piece</h3>

<div class='unindent'>may be made of two pieces, as is shown at G and F (<a href="#Fig_195">Fig. 195</a>)
or if you are more skilful than the ordinary non-professional, the
stem may be made of one piece, as shown by the lower diagram
at F (<a href="#Fig_195">Fig. 195</a>). It is desirable to have oak for the stem, but any
hard wood will answer the purpose, and even pine may be used
when no better is to be had. Take a piece of cardboard or an old
shingle on which to draw a pattern for the end of the stem and
make the outline with a lead-pencil by placing the shingle over
the apex <i>c</i> of diagram E (<a href="#Fig_195">Fig. 195</a>); from the inside trace the line
of the sides thus, <b>V</b>. Trim your stem down to correspond to these
lines and let the stick be somewhat longer than the width of the
sides A, A.</div>

</div>

<p>When this is done to your satisfaction, fit the stem in place and
nail the side boards to the stem.</p>

<p>Turn the boat over and nail on a bottom of 1-inch boards as
shown by <a href="#Fig_196">Fig. 196</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>


<h3>Don't</h3>

<div class='unindent'>use tongue and grooved or any sort of fancy cabinet or floor joining
when wet&mdash;such matched lumber warps up in waves&mdash;but
use boards with smooth, flat edges; if these are true and fitted
snugly together in workmanlike manner the first wetting will swell
them in a very short time, until not a drop of water will leak
through the cracks, for the reason that there will be none. Fit
the bottom-boards on regardless of their protruding ends, as these
may be sawed off after the boards are nailed in place.</div>

<div class="caption">Fig. 197.&mdash;Details of bow, stern, seats, and finished boat.</div>
</div>


<h3>The Seats</h3>

<div class='unindent'>consist of a triangular one at the bow (J), the oarsman's seat
(L), and the stern seat (K, <a href="#Fig_197">Fig. 197</a>). The bow seat is made of
1-inch boards nailed to two cleats shown at M (<a href="#Fig_197">Fig. 197</a>). N
shows the bench for the stern seat and O explains the arrangement
of the oarsman's seat a little forward amidship. As may be
seen, it rests upon the cleats <i>x</i> (diagram O, <a href="#Fig_197">Fig. 197</a>), which are
fitted between two upright cleats on each side of the boat; this
makes a seat which will not slip out of place, and the cleats serve
to strengthen the sides of the otherwise ribless boat. Make the
cleats of 1 by 2 inch lumber and let the seat be about 12 inches
wide. The stern seat may be wider, 1½ feet at K and 4 or 5 inches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
more at the long sides of the two boards each side of K (<a href="#Fig_197">Fig. 197</a>).
Of course, it is not necessary to fit a board in against the stern-piece,
for a cleat will answer the purpose, but a good, heavy stern-piece
is often desirable and the board shown in diagram N (<a href="#Fig_197">Fig.
197</a>) will serve to add strength to the stern as well as to furnish a
firm rest for the stern seat, but it will also add weight.</div>

<div class="caption">Fig. 199.&mdash;Fitting the skeg.</div>
</div>


<h3>The Keel-Board</h3>

<div class='unindent'>is an advisable addition to the boat, but may also be omitted without
serious results (H, <a href="#Fig_197">Fig. 197</a>).</div>

<p>The keel-board should be 4½ inches wide, 1 inch thick, and
should be cut pointed, to fit snugly in the bow, and nailed in place
along the centre of the floor, before the seats are put in the boat.
A similar board along the bottom, joining the two cleats each side
of the skeg at <i>y</i> (<a href="#Fig_199">Fig. 199</a>) and extending to the bow will prevent
the danger of loosening the bottom-planks when bumping over
rifts, shallow places, or when the boat needs to be hauled on a
stony shore; this bottom-board may also be omitted to save time
and lumber and is not shown in the diagram.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>


<h3>The Skeg</h3>

<div class='unindent'>is a triangular board (<a href="#Fig_198">Figs. 198</a> and <a href="#Fig_199">199</a>), roughly speaking, of
the same dimensions as the pieces sawed from the side-board
<i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, <i>d</i> (<a href="#Fig_196">Fig. 196</a>). The stern-end will be about 7 inches wide and
it will taper off to nothing at <i>y</i> (<a href="#Fig_198">Fig. 198</a>). The skeg is held in
place by cleats of 1-inch lumber, 2 inches wide, nailed to the bottom
on each side of the skeg. To get the proper dimensions experiment
with the pieces sawed from the A boards and cut your
skeg board so that its bottom edge will be level with the bottom at
<i>y</i> (<a href="#Fig_198">Fig. 198</a>); the diagonal line, to correspond with the slant of
the stern, can be accurately drawn if the skeg is left untrimmed
until it is fastened in place.</div>

</table></div>



<h3>To Fasten on the Skeg</h3>

<div class='unindent'>rule a line from the centre of the stern to the centre of the bow
and toe-nail the skeg on along this line. This must be accurately
done or you will make a boat which will have an uncomfortable
tendency to move in circles. After toe-nailing the skeg to the bottom,
nail the two cleats, one on each side of the skeg, and let them
fit as closely as may be to the keel. Now saw off the stern-ends
of the cleats and lay a rule along the stern, as the stick is placed in
<a href="#Fig_198">Fig. 198</a>, where the boy has his finger; rule a pencil line across the
protruding end of the keel and saw off the end along the diagonal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
line, so that the stern-cleat <i>z</i> (<a href="#Fig_198">Fig. 198</a>) may be nailed in place to
finish the work.</div>

<p>You can buy rowlocks of galvanized iron for about a quarter
of a dollar a pair; the brass ones are not expensive, but even when
the store furnishes the hardware there must be a firm support of
some sort to hold the rowlock.</p>

<p>If you use the manufactured article, to be found at any hardware
store, the merchant will supply you with the screws, plates,
and rowlocks, but he will not furnish you with the blocks for the
holes in which the spindles of the rowlocks fit. <a href="#Fig_202">Fig. 202</a> shows a
rude, but serviceable, support for the lock made of short oaken
posts much in vogue in Pennsylvania, but <a href="#Fig_201">Fig. 201</a> is much better,
and if it is made of oak and bolted to the sides of the boat it will
last as long as the boat. <a href="#Fig_201">Fig. 201</a> may be put upon either the outside
or inside of the boat, according to the width amidship.</p>


<h3>A Guard Rail</h3>

<div class='unindent'>or fender, of 1 by 2 inch lumber, alongside of and even with the
top of the side-boards, from bow to stern, gives finish and strength
to the craft; but in a cheap boat, or a hastily constructed one, this
may be omitted, as it is in these diagrams.</div>

<p>If you are building your boat out of the convenient reach of
the hardware shop, you must make your own rowlocks. <a href="#Fig_200">Fig.
200</a> shows the crude ones formerly used by the raftsmen for the
Yankee pines, and <a href="#Fig_203">Figs. 203</a> and <a href="#Fig_204">204</a> show rowlocks made with the
oaken or hard-wood thole-pins fitting in holes cut for that purpose
in the form of notches (U, <a href="#Fig_204">Fig. 204</a>) in the side of the boat,
or as spaces left between the blocks, as shown by R (<a href="#Fig_203">Fig. 203</a>).
When the side-boards A, A of the boat are notched a cleat of hard
wood 5 or 6 inches wide, and extending some distance each side
of the side-boards, must be used, as is shown by diagram V (<a href="#Fig_204">Fig.
204</a>) and <a href="#Fig_203">Fig. 203</a>. The diagram R (<a href="#Fig_203">Fig. 203</a>) explains itself;
there is a centre block nailed to the side-board and two more each
side, leaving spaces for the thole-pins T (<a href="#Fig_203">Fig. 203</a>) to fit and
guarded by another piece (R) bolted through to the sides.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>If bolts are out of your reach, nails and screws may act as substitutes,
and <a href="#Fig_204">Fig. 204</a> will then be the best form of rowlock to
adopt.</p>

<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="illustrations">

</table></div>

<p>To fix the place for rowlocks, seat yourself in the oarsman's
seat, grasp the oars as in rowing, and mark the place which best
fits the reach of your arms and oars as in rowing. It will probably
be about 13 inches aft from the centre of the seat.</p>

<h3>To Transform an Ordinary Skiff or Scow Into a Sailing-Boat</h3>

<p>It is necessary to build the centreboard box and cut a hole
through the bottom of the boat. For the average row-boat or
skiff, you can make the centreboard box about 48 inches long
and not higher, of course, than the gunwales of the boat. Make
the box of 2-inch plank, and before nailing the sides together
coat the seams thoroughly with white lead so as to prevent it
from leaking. The centreboard should be made of 2-inch plank,
which when planed down and smoothed will be about 1<small><sup>7</sup>/<sub>8</sub></small> of an inch
thick, and the space in the box should be wide enough to allow it
to move freely up and down, with no danger of its jamming. A
hole should be cut in the bottom of the boat to correspond with the
opening in the centreboard box, which, with a 48-inch box, will
probably be an opening of 40 inches long and 1 inch wide. The
centreboard is hinged to the box by a bolt run through at the
point marked A on <a href="#Fig_205">Fig. 205</a>. The centreboard should move
freely on the bolt, but the bolt itself should fit tightly in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
sides of the box, otherwise the water will leak through. There
will be no danger of the bolt's turning in its socket if the
hole through the centreboard through which the bolt is thrust is
made large enough. The centreboard box should be generously
painted with white lead on the bottom edges where it fits on the
floor of the boat around the centreboard hole. The bottom of
the boat floor should also be coated with white lead and over this
a strip of muslin spread before the box is securely nailed to the floor
of the boat from the bottom or under side of the boat. When this
is done the muslin covering the hole can be cut away with a sharp<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
knife. A rope may then be fastened to the loose end of the centreboard
with a cross-stick attached to the end of the rope to prevent
it from slipping down the hole in the box. With this rope the
centreboard may be raised or lowered to suit the pleasure of the
sailor. (<a href="#Fig_205">Fig. 205</a>.)</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII<br />
<small>A "ROUGH-AND-READY" BOAT</small></h2>

<div class='summary2'>Just What One Must Do to Build It&mdash;Detailed Instructions as to
How to Make the Boat and How to Rig It</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Good</span> straight-grained pine wood is, without doubt, the best
"all-around" wood for general use. It is easily whittled with a
pocket-knife; it works smoothly under a plane; can be sawed
without fatiguing the amateur carpenter; it is elastic and pliable;
therefore use pine lumber to build your boat.</p>

<p>Examine the lumber pile carefully and select four boards nearly
alike. Do not allow the dealer or his men to talk you into taking
lumber with blemishes. The side pieces should be of straight-grained
wood, with no large knots and no "checks" (cracks) in
them, and must not be "wind shaken."</p>

<p>Measure the wood and see that it is over twenty-two feet long
by one foot four or five inches wide and one inch thick. Trim
two of the side-pieces until they are exact duplicates (<a href="#Fig_206">Fig. 206</a>).
The stem-piece (or bow-piece) should be made from a triangular
piece of oak (<a href="#Fig_212">Fig. 212</a>), and it is wise to make it a few inches longer
than will be necessary, so that there may be no danger of finding,
after all your labor, that the stick is too short; much better too
long, for it is a simple matter to saw it off. Make a second stem-piece
(<a href="#Fig_213">Fig. 213</a>) of oak about one inch thick and the same length
as the first, and two or three inches wide, or twice as wide as the
thickness of the side-boards.</p>


<h3>The Stern-piece</h3>

<p>The stern-piece can be fashioned out of two-inch pine boards,
and may be made as wide or narrow as you choose. A narrow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
stern makes a trim-looking craft. With your saw cut off the corner
of the tail-piece, so that it will be in the form of a blunted triangle
(<a href="#Fig_214">Fig. 214</a>), measuring three feet ten and one-half inches
across the base, three feet four inches on each side, and nine and
one-half inches at the apex. The base of the triangle will be the
top and the apex will be the bottom of the stern-board of your
boat.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><a id="Fig_206"></a><a id="Fig_207"></a><a id="Fig_208"></a><a id="Fig_209"></a><a id="Fig_210"></a>
<img src="images/i_168.png" width="600" height="417" alt="drawings" />
<div class="caption">Diagrams showing the construction of the rough-and-ready.</div>
</div>

<p>Now make a brace on which to model your boat. Let it be of
two-inch pine wood, two and one-half feet wide and seven and
one-half feet long (<a href="#Fig_207">Fig. 207</a>). Measure twelve inches on one
edge of this board from each end toward the centre and mark the
points; then rule lines from these points diagonally across the
width of the board (A, B and C, D&mdash;Fig. 207), and saw off the
corners, as shown by the dotted line in <a href="#Fig_207">Fig. 207</a>.</p>

<p>Lay the boards selected for the lower side-boards on a level floor
and measure off one and one-half foot on the bottom edge, then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
in a line with the end of the board mark a point on the floor that
would be the top edge of the board if the board were two and one-half
feet wide; rule a line from the point on the floor to the point
marked on the board and saw off the corner as marked; make the
other side-piece correspond exactly with the first (<a href="#Fig_206">Fig. 206</a>).</p>


<h3>Use Rope for Binding</h3>

<p>Set the side-pieces upon their bottoms or shorter edges and place
the brace between the sides. Now bind the stern ends with a
rope and bring the bow-pieces together until they touch; rope
them in this position, and when all is fast push the brace up until
it rests at a point nine feet from the bow; fasten it here with a
couple of nails driven in, but leaving their heads far enough from
the wood to render it easy to draw them out. Now adjust the
bow-piece, and use the greatest of care in making the sides exactly
alike, otherwise you will wonder how you happened to have such
an unaccountable twist in your craft. When the stem is properly
adjusted fasten on the side-boards with screws. Do not try to
hammer the screws in place, but bore holes first and use a screwdriver.</p>

<p>Take your stern-piece and measure the exact width of the stern
end of the bottom-boards and mark it at the bottom of the stern-piece;
or, better still, since the stern-board will set at an angle, put
it temporarily in place, bind it fast with the ropes, and mark with
a pencil just where the side-boards cross the ends of the
stern-board. Remove the stern-board and saw out a piece one inch
wide, the thickness of the bottom-board, from the place marked
to the bottom of the stern-board. Because the top side-board
overlaps the bottom one at the stern, there must be either a large
crack left there or the stern-board notched to fit the side-boards
(<a href="#Fig_214">Fig. 214</a>). Replace the stern-board and nail side-boards fast
to it; now loosen the ropes which have held your boat in shape,
and fit on the upper side-boards so that at the stern they will overlap
the lower side-boards an inch. Hold in place with your rope,
then bring the bow end up against the stern-piece over the top of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
the lower side-board and fasten it in place with a rope. With your
carpenter's pencil mark the overlap, and with a plane made for
that purpose, called a rabbet, trim down your board so that it will
have a shoulder and an overlap to rest on the bottom-board, running
out to nothing at the bow. When the boards fit all right
over the lower ones bind them in place and then nail them there
(<a href="#Fig_208">Fig. 208</a>). If you can obtain two good boards of the requisite
size, you need have but one board for each side of your boat;
this will obviate the necessity of using the rabbet, and be very
much easier; but with single boards of the required dimensions
there is great danger of splitting or cracking while bending the
boards.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 681px;"><a id="Fig_211"></a><a id="Fig_212"></a><a id="Fig_213"></a><a id="Fig_214"></a><a id="Fig_215"></a>
<img src="images/i_170.png" width="681" height="464" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption">The rough-and-ready.</div>
</div>


<h3>Planing the Bottom</h3>

<p>Turn the boat upside down and you will see that there is a decided
arch extending from stem to stern. This would cause the
boat to sink too deep amidship, and must be remedied to some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
extent by cutting away the middle of the arch, so that the sides
in the exact centre will measure at least four inches less in width
than at the bow and stern, and reducing the convex or curved form
to a straight line in the middle, which will give a sheer to the bow
and stern. A good plane is the best tool to use for this purpose,
as with it there is no danger of cutting too deep or of splitting the
side-boards. Saw off the projecting ends of the side-boards at the
stern.</p>

<p>Make the bottom of three-quarter-inch boards, they may be
bevelled like <a href="#Fig_231">Fig. 231</a>. Lay the boards crosswise, nail them in
place, leaving the irregular ends projecting on each side. The
reason for this is obvious. When you look at the bottom of the
boat you will at once see that on account of the form no two
boards can be the same shape, and the easiest way is to treat the
boat bottom as if it were a square-sided scow. Fit the planks
closely together, nail them on securely, and then neatly saw off
the projecting ends (<a href="#Fig_210">Fig. 210</a>).</p>


<h3>The Deck</h3>

<p>The brace may now be removed by carefully drawing the nails,
so that a bottom plank trimmed to fit the bow and the stern can
be securely nailed in place (<a href="#Fig_216">Fig. 216</a>). Cut a notch in your brace
to fit tightly over the bottom plank just laid. Plane off the top
of the brace so that when in the boat the top of the brace will be
four inches below the top of the side-boards. Replace the brace
and securely nail it. Next cut two small cross-pieces (F, G, <a href="#Fig_209">Fig.
209</a>) and place them near the bow, four inches below the top of the
sides of the boat. Drive the nails from the outside through the
side-boards into the end of F and G, the cross-brace. Cut out a
bow-piece to fit from the middle of G to the bow and nail it in
place, driving the nails from the outside into the edge of the bow-piece.
Fasten a small cleat along the boat from the solid board
brace to F on each side and deck the space over with light lumber.</p>

<p>Of the same material make a trap door to fit in between the
braces F and G. This door should be big enough for a boy to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
reach through, for this compartment is intended as a safe place to
store cooking utensils, foods, etc., as well as a water-tight compartment.
At a point five feet from the stern put another cross-brace,
similar to the ones in the bow, four inches below the top of the
sides. At the same level nail a cleat on the stern-piece and make
a stern seat by boarding over between the cross-piece and the cleat.
When your boat is resting securely on the floor or level ground rig
a temporary seat, then take an oar and by experiment find just
where the rowlock will be most convenient and mark the spot.
Also mark the spot best suited for the seat. On each side of the
spot marked for the rowlock cut two notches in the side-boards
two inches deep, one and a half inch wide, and three inches
apart. Saw two more notches exactly like these upon the opposite
side of your boat. These will make the rowlocks when the side-strips
are nailed on (<a href="#Fig_216">Fig. 216</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 689px;"><a id="Fig_216"></a>
<img src="images/i_172.png" width="689" height="201" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 216.&mdash;Top view of rough-and-ready, with tiller stick.</div>
</div>

<p>The side-strips should each be made of one-inch plank three
inches wide and a few inches longer than the side-boards. Nail
the strips on the outside of the boat flush with the top of the side-boards.
Make your thole-pins of some hard wood, and make
two sets of them while you are about it, "one set to use and one
set to lose." Screw a hard-wood cleat on the inside of your boat
over each pair of rowlocks, as shown in <a href="#Fig_216">Fig. 216</a>.</p>


<h3>Ready for the Water</h3>

<p>Fasten the remaining bow-piece securely over the ends of your
side-boards, and the nose of your craft is finished.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>Put a good, heavy keel on your boat by screwing it tightly in the
stern to the hard-wood rudder-post that is fastened to the centre
of the stern; bolt your keel with four iron bolts (<a href="#Fig_211">Fig. 211</a>) to the
bottom of the boat, and the ship is ready to launch, after which
she can be equipped with sails and oars.</p>

<p>Of course, you understand that all nail-holes and crevices
should be puttied up, and if paint is used, it must be applied before
wetting the boat. But if you have done your work well, there
will be little need of paint or putty to make it tight after the wood
has swelled in the water. Fasten your rudder on with hooks and
screw-eyes, and make it as shown in the diagram (<a href="#Fig_211">Fig. 211</a>).
Step your mainmast in the bow through a round hole in the deck
and a square hole in the step, which must, of course, be screwed
tightly to the bottom before the bow is decked over.</p>

<p>Step your jigger or dandy mast in the stern after the same manner.
These masts should neither of them be very large, and are
intended to be removed at pleasure by unstepping them, that is,
simply pulling them out of their sockets. An outrigger will be
found necessary for your dandy-sail, and since the deck aft is below
the sides of the boat, a block of wood will have to be nailed to
the deck to the starboard, or right-hand, side of the rudder-post.
If the builder chooses, he can make the decks flush with the sides
of the boat and thus avoid blocks. A couple of staples for the
out-rigger to slip through are next in order. They must be fastened
firmly in the block or stick of wood just nailed to the deck.
A similar arrangement can be made for the bowsprit, but as it is
a movable bowsprit, and the stem of the boat is in the way, put
it to the port, or left-hand, side of the stem of the craft (<a href="#Fig_216">Fig. 216</a>).</p>


<h3>How to Make the Sail</h3>
<div class="figleft" style="width: 201px;"><a id="Fig_217"></a>
<img src="images/i_174.png" width="201" height="646" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 217, with tiller.&mdash;Rudder lines.</div>
</div>
<p>Secure for a sail material as strong as you can find, but it need
not be heavy. Unbleached muslin is cheap and will make good
sails. Turn over the edges and sew or hem them, as in the diagram.
Make eyelets like button-holes in the luff of the sail&mdash;that
is, the edge of the sail nearest the mast. Sew a small loop of rope<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
in each corner of the sail. Through
the eyelets lace the luff of the sail to
the mast.</p>

<p>From spruce or pine make a sprit
two inches in diameter. For a "sheet"&mdash;that
is, the rope or line that you
manage the sail with&mdash;tie a good stout
line about a dozen feet long to the
loop in the loose corner of the sail.
Trim the upper end of the sprit to fit
the loop in the top of the sail and make
a simple notch in the other end to hold
the line called the "snotter."</p>

<p>Now, as you can readily see by referring
to <a href="#Fig_211">Fig. 211</a>, when the sprit is
pushed into the loop at the top of the
sail the sail is spread. To hold it in
place make a cleat like the one in the
diagram and bind it firmly with a
cord to the sprit; pass the snotter, or
line, fastened to the mast through the
notch in the sprit up to the cleat and
make fast, and the sail is set. The
jigger, or dandy, is exactly like the
mainsail except in size, and the sheet
rope is run through a block or pulley
at the end of the outrigger and then
made fast to a cleat near the man at
the rudder or helm. The jib is a
simple affair hooked on a screw-eye in
the end of the bowsprit. The jib halyard,
or line for hoisting the jib, runs
from the top of the jib through a screw-eye in the top of the mast,
down the port side of the mast to a cleat, where it is made fast.
When the jib is set the jib-sheets are fastened to a loop sewed in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
the jib at the lower or loose end. There are two jib-sheets, one
for each side of the boat, so that one may be made fast and the
other loosened, according to the wind. The remaining details
you must study out from the diagrams or learn by experiment.</p>


<h3>How to Reef Her</h3>

<p>When the wind is high reef your sails by letting go the snotter
and pulling out the sprit. This will drop your peak and leave
you with a simple leg-of-mutton sail. Only use the jib in light
weather.</p>

<p>In this boat, with a little knowledge of sailing, you may cruise
for weeks, lowering your sails at night and making a tent over the
cock-pit for a sleeping-room. Sails with boom and gaffs may be
used if desired.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV<br />
<small>HOW TO BUILD CHEAP AND SUBSTANTIAL HOUSE-BOATS</small></h2>

<div class='summary2'>Plans for a House-Boat that May Be a Camp or Built as Large
as a Hotel</div>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> the great West of the United States began to attract immigrants
from the Eastern coast settlements, the Ohio River
rolled between banks literally teeming with all sorts of wild game
and wilder men: then it was that the American house-boat had its
birth.</p>

<p>The Mississippi, Ohio, and their tributaries furnished highways
for easy travel, of which the daring pioneers soon availed themselves.</p>

<p>Lumber was to be had for the labor of felling the trees. From
the borders of the Eastern plantations to the prairies, and below
the Ohio to the Mississippi, and from the Great Lakes to the Gulf
of Mexico, was one vast forest of trees; trees whose trunks were
unscarred by the axe, and whose tall tops reached an altitude
which would hardly be believed by those of this generation, who
have only seen second, third, or fourth growth timber.</p>

<p>When the settlement of this new part of the country began it was
not long before each stream poured out, with its own flood of
water,</p>


<h3>A Unique Navy</h3>

<p>There were keel-boats, built something like a modern canal-boat,
only of much greater dimensions; there were broad-horns,
looking like Noak's arks from some giant's toy-shop, and there
were flat-boats and rafts, the latter with houses built on them, all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
recklessly drifting, or being propelled by long sweeps down the current
into the great solemn, unknown wilderness.</p>

<p>Every island, had it a tongue, could tell of wrecks; every point
or headland, of adventure.</p>

<p>The perils were great and the forest solemn, but the immigrants
were merry, and the squeaking fiddle made the red man rise up
from his hiding-place and look with wonder upon the "long
knives" and their squaws dancing on the decks of their rude crafts,
as they swept by into the unknown.</p>

<p>The advent of the steam-boat gradually drove the flat-boat,
broad-horn, keel-boat, and all the primitive sweep-propelled craft
from the rivers, but many of the old boatmen were loath to give
up so pleasant a mode of existence, and they built themselves
house-boats, and, still clinging to their nomadic habits, took their
wives, and went to house-keeping on the bosom of the waters they
loved so well.</p>

<p>Their descendants now form what might well be called a race
of river-dwellers, and to this day their quaint little arks line the
shores of the Mississippi and its tributaries.</p>


<h3>Some of These House-Boats</h3>

<div class='unindent'>are as crudely made as the Italian huts we see built along the railroads,
but others are neatly painted, and the interiors are like the
proverbial New England homes, where everything is spick-and-span.</div>

<p>Like the driftwood, these boats come down the stream with
every freshet, and whenever it happens that the waters are particularly
high they land at some promising spot and earn a livelihood
on the adjacent water, by fishing and working aboard the
other river-craft, or they land at some farming district, and as the
waters recede they prop up and level their boats, on the bank, with
stones or blocks of wood placed under the lower corners of their
homes.</p>

<p>The muddy waters, as they retire, leave a long stretch of fertile
land between the stranded house and the river, and this space is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
utilized as a farm, where ducks, chickens, goats and pigs are
raised and where garden-truck grows luxuriantly.</p>

<p>From a boat their home has been transformed to a farm-house;
but sooner or later there will be another big freshet, and when
the waters reach the late farm-house, lo! it is a boat again, and goes
drifting in its happy-go-lucky way down the current. If it escapes
the perils of snags and the monster battering-rams, which the rapid
current makes of the drifting trees in the flood, it will land again,
somewhere, down-stream.</p>

<p>Lately, while on a sketching trip through Kentucky, I was
greatly interested in these boats, and on the Ohio River I saw
several making good headway against the four-mile-an-hour current.
This they did by the aid of</p>


<h3>Big Square Sails</h3>

<div class='unindent'>spread on a mast planted near their bows, thus demonstrating
the practicability of the use of sails for house-boats.</div>

<p>The house-boats to be described in this article are much better
adapted for sailing than any of the craft used by the water-gypsies
of the Western rivers.</p>

<p>For open and exposed waters, like the large lakes which dot
many of our inland States, or the Long Island Sound on our coast,
the following plans of the American boy's house-boat will have to
be altered, but the alterations will be all in the hull. If you make
the hull three feet deep it will have the effect of lowering the cabin,
while the head-room inside will remain the same. Such a craft
can carry a good-sized sail, and weather any gale you are liable
to encounter, even on the Sound, during the summer months.</p>

<p>Since the passing away of the glorious old flat-boat days, idle
people in England have introduced the</p>


<h3>House-Boat as a Fashionable Fad</h3>

<div class='unindent'>which has spread to this country, and the boys now have a new
source of fun, as a result of this English fad.</div>

<p>There are still some nooks and corners left in every State in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
Union which the greedy pot-hunter and the devouring saw-mill
have as yet left undisturbed, and at such places the boy boatmen
may "wind their horns," as their ancestors did of old, and have
almost as good a time. But first of all they must have a boat, and
for convenience the American boy's house-boat will probably be
found to excel either a broad-horn
or a flat-boat model, it
being a link between the two.</p>

<p>The simplest possible house-boat
is a Crusoe raft,<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> with a
cabin near the stern and a
sand-box for a camp-fire at the
bow. A good time can be had aboard even this primitive craft.
The next step in evolution is the long open scow, with a cabin
formed by stretching canvas over hoops that reach from side to
side of the boat (see <a href="#Fig_218">Fig. 218</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 517px;"><a id="Fig_218"></a>
<img src="images/i_179.png" width="517" height="194" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 218.&mdash;A primitive house-boat.</div>
</div>

<p>Every boy knows how to build</p>


<h3>A Flat-Bottomed Scow</h3>

<div class='unindent'>or at least every boy should know how to make as simple a craft
as the scow, but for fear some lad among my readers has neglected
this part of his education, I will give a few hints which he may
follow.</div>


<h3>Building Material</h3>

<p>Select lumber that is free from large knots and other blemishes.
Keep the two best boards for the sides of your boat. With your
saw cut the side boards into the form of <a href="#Fig_219">Fig. 219</a>; see that they
are exact duplicates. Set the two pieces parallel to each other
upon their straight or top edges, as the first two pieces shown
in <a href="#Fig_220">Fig. 220</a>. Nail on an end-piece at the bow and stern, as the
bumper is nailed in <a href="#Fig_221">Figs. 221</a> and <a href="#Fig_222">222</a>; put the bottom on as
shown in <a href="#Fig_196">Figs. 196</a> and <a href="#Fig_210">210</a>, and you have a simple scow.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>


<h3>Centrepiece</h3>

<p>In <a href="#Fig_219">Fig. 219</a> you will notice that there are two sides and a centrepiece,
but this centrepiece is not necessary for the ordinary open
boat, shown by <a href="#Fig_218">Fig. 218</a>. Here you have one of the simple forms
of house-boat, and you can make it of dimensions to suit your convenience.
I will not occupy space with the details of this boat,
because they may be seen by a glance at the diagrams, and my purpose
is to tell you how to build the American boy's house-boat,
which is a more elegant craft than the rude open scow, with a canvas-covered
cabin, shown by <a href="#Fig_218">Fig. 218</a>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 676px;"><a id="Fig_219"></a>
<img src="images/i_180.png" width="676" height="318" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 219.&mdash;Unfinished.</div>
</div>


<h3>The Sides of the House-Boat</h3>

<div class='unindent'>are 16 feet long, and to make them you need some sound two-inch
planks. After selecting the lumber plane it off and make the
edges true and straight. Each side and the centrepiece should
now measure exactly 16 feet in length by 14 inches in width, and
about 2 inches thick. Cut off from each end of each piece a triangle,
as shown by the dotted lines at G, H, I (<a href="#Fig_220">Fig. 220</a>); from H
to G is 1 foot, and from H to I is 7 inches. Measure from H to I
7 inches, and mark the point. Then measure from H to G, 12<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
inches, and mark the point. Then, with a carpenter's pencil,
draw a line from G to I, and saw along this line. Keep the two
best planks for the sides of your boat, and use the one that is left
for the centrepiece. Measure 2 feet on the top or straight edge
of your centrepiece, and mark the point A (<a href="#Fig_220">Fig. 220</a>). From A
measure 8 feet 10 inches, and mark the point C (<a href="#Fig_220">Fig. 220</a>).</div>

<p>With a carpenter's square rule the lines A, B and C, D, and
make them each 10 inches long, then rule the line B, D (<a href="#Fig_220">Fig. 220</a>).
The piece A, B, C, D must now be carefully cut out: this can be
done by using the saw to cut A, B and D, C. Then, about 6
inches from A, saw another line of the same length, and with a
chisel cut the block out. You then have room to insert a rip-saw,
at B, and can saw along the line B, D until you reach D, when the
piece may be removed, leaving the space A, B, D, C for the cabin
of the boat (see <a href="#Fig_221">Figs. 221</a> and <a href="#Fig_222">222</a>.)</p>

<p>At a point 9 inches from the bow of the boat make a mark on
the centrepiece, and another mark 5 inches farther away, at F
(<a href="#Fig_220">Fig. 220</a>). With the saw cut a slit at each mark, 1 inch deep,
and with a chisel cut out, as shown by the dotted lines; do the
same at E, leaving a space of 1½ feet between the two notches,
which are made to allow the two planks shown in the plan (<a href="#Fig_221">Fig.
221</a>) to rest on. These planks support the deck and the hatch,
at the locker in the bow. The notches at E and F are not on the
side-boards, the planks being supported at the sides by uprights,
<a href="#Fig_221">Figs. 221</a> and <a href="#Fig_222">222</a>.</p>

<p>All that now remains to be done with the centrepiece is to saw
some three-cornered notches on bottom edge, one at bow, one at
stern, and one or two amidship; this is to allow the water which
may leak in to flow freely over the whole bottom, and to prevent it
from gathering at one side and causing your craft to rest upon
an uneven keel.</p>

<p>Next select a level piece of ground near by and arrange the
three pieces upon some supports, as shown in <a href="#Fig_219">Fig. 219</a>, so that
from outside to outside of side-pieces it will measure just 8 feet
across the bow and stern. Of 1-inch board</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a><br /><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>


<h3>Make Four End-Pieces</h3>

<div class='unindent'>for the bow and stern (see A, A´, <a href="#Fig_219">Fig. 219</a>), to fit between the
sides and centrepiece. Make them each a trifle wider than H,
I, <a href="#Fig_220">Fig. 220</a>, so that after they have been fitted they can be trimmed
down with a plane, and bevelled on the same slant as the bottom
at G, I, <a href="#Fig_220">Fig. 220</a>. It being 8 feet between the outside of each
centrepiece, and the sides and the centrepiece being each 2 inches
thick, that gives us 8 feet 6 inches, or 7½ feet as the combined
length of A and A´ (<a href="#Fig_219">Fig. 219</a>). In other words, each end-piece
will be half of 7½ feet long&mdash;that is, 3 feet 9 inches long. After
making the four end-pieces, each 3 feet 9, by 9 inches, fit the ends
in place so that there is an inch protruding above and below.
See that your bow and stern are perfectly square, and nail with
wire nails through the sides into A and A´; toe-nail at the centrepiece&mdash;that
is, drive the nails from the broad side of A and A´
slantingly, into the centrepiece, after which trim down with your
plane the projecting inch on bottom, to agree with the slant of the
bottom of the boat.</div>


<h3>Now for the Bottom</h3>

<p>This is simple work. All that is necessary is to have straight,
true edges to your one-inch planks, fit them together, and nail them
in place. Of course, when you come to the slant at bow and stern
the bottom-boards at each end will have to have a bevelled edge,
to fit snugly against the boards on the flat part of the bottom of
the boat; but any boy who is accustomed to shake the gray matter
in his brain can do this. Remember, scientists say that thought
is the agitation of the gray matter of the brain, and if you are going
to build a boat or play a good game of football you must shake
up that gray stuff, or the other boys will put you down as a "stuff."
No boy can expect to be successful in building a boat, of even the
crudest type, unless he keeps his wits about him, so I shall take
it for granted that there are no "stuffs" among my readers.</p>

<p>After the boards are all snugly nailed on the bottom, and fitted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
together so that there are no cracks to calk up; the hull is ready to
have</p>


<h3>The Bumpers</h3>

<div class='unindent'>nailed in place, at bow and stern. See the plan, <a href="#Fig_221">Fig. 221</a>, and
the elevation, <a href="#Fig_222">Fig. 222</a>. The bumpers must be made of 2-inch
plank, 8 feet long by about 9 inches wide; wide enough to cover
A and A´ of <a href="#Fig_219">Fig. 219</a>, and to leave room for a bevel at the bottom
edge to meet the slant of the bow and stern, and still have room
at the top to cover the edge of the deck to the hull (see <a href="#Fig_222">Fig. 222</a>).</div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 683px;"><a id="Fig_222"></a>

</div>
<div class='tnote'><div class='center'>[Transcriber's Note: To see a larger version of this

<h3>The Hull May Now Be Painted</h3>

<div class='unindent'>with two coats of good paint, and after it is dry may be turned
over and allowed to rest on a number of round sticks, called rollers.</div>

<p>If you will examine <a href="#Fig_221">Fig. 221</a> you will see there</p>


<h3>Twenty-Odd Ribs</h3>

<p>These are what are called two-by-fours-that is, 2 inches thick
by 4 inches wide. They support the floor of the cabin and forward
locker, at the same time adding strength to the hull.</p>

<p>The ribs are each the same length as the end-board. A and A´
of <a href="#Fig_219">Fig. 219</a>, are nailed in place in the same manner. Each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
bottom-rib must have a notch 2 inches deep cut in the bottom
edge to allow the free passage of water, so as to enable you to
pump dry. Commencing at the stern, the distance between the
inside of the bumper and the first rib is 1 foot 6 inches. This is a
deck-rib, as may be seen by reference to <a href="#Fig_221">Figs. 221</a> and <a href="#Fig_222">222</a>. After
measuring 1½ foot from the bumper, on inside of side-board, mark
the point with a carpenter's pencil. Measure the same distance
on the centrepiece, and mark the point as before; then carefully
fit your rib in flush or even with the top of the side-piece, and fasten
it in place by nails driven through the side-board into the end of
the rib, and toe-nailed to centrepiece. Do the same with its mate
on the other side of centrepiece.</p>


<h3>The Cabin of this House-Boat</h3>

<div class='unindent'>is to fit in the space, A, B, D, C of the centrepiece, <a href="#Fig_220">Fig. 220</a>.
There is to be a one-inch plank at each end (see <a href="#Fig_222">Fig. 222</a>), next
to which the side-supports at each end of cabin fit. The supports
are two-by-twos; so, allowing 1 inch for the plank and 2 inches
for the upright support, the next pair of ribs will be just 3 inches
from A B, <a href="#Fig_220">Fig. 220</a>, of the centrepiece (see <a href="#Fig_221">Figs. 221</a> and <a href="#Fig_222">222</a>).
The twin ribs at the forward end of the cabin will be the same
distance from D C, <a href="#Fig_220">Fig. 220</a>, as shown in the plan and elevation,
<a href="#Fig_221">Figs. 221</a> and <a href="#Fig_222">222</a>. This leaves five pairs of ribs to be distributed
between the front and back end of the cabin. From the outside
of each end-support to the inside of the nearest middle-support
is 2 feet 6 inches. Allowing 2 inches for the supports, this will
place the adjoining ribs 2 feet 8 inches from the outside of the
end-supports. The other ribs are placed midway between, as
may be seen by the elevation, <a href="#Fig_222">Fig. 222</a>.</div>

<p>There is another pair of</p>


<h3>Deck-Ribs</h3>

<div class='unindent'>at the forward end of the cabin, which are placed flush with the
line D, C, <a href="#Fig_220">Fig. 220</a> (see <a href="#Fig_221">Figs. 221</a> and <a href="#Fig_222">222</a>). The two pairs of ribs
in the bow are spaced, as shown in the diagram. This description<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
may appear as if it was a complicated affair; but you will find it a
simple thing to work out if you will remember to allow space for
your pump in the stern, space for the end-planks at after and forward
end of cabin, and space for your uprights. The planks at
after and forward end of cabin are to box in the cabin floor.</div>


<h3>The Boat May Now Be Launched</h3>

<div class='unindent'>by sliding it over the rollers, which will not be found a difficult
operation.</div>


<div class='unindent'>The Plans Show Three Lockers</div>

<div class='unindent'>&mdash;two in the bow under the hatch and one under the rear bunk&mdash;but
if it is deemed necessary the space between-decks, at each
side of the cabin, may be utilized as lockers. In this space you
can store enough truck to last for months. A couple of doors in
the plank at the front of the cabin opening, under the deck, will
be found very convenient to reach the forward locker in wet
weather.</div>


<h3>The Keel</h3>

<div class='unindent'>is a triangular piece of 2-inch board, made to fit exactly in the middle
of the stern, and had best be nailed in place before the boat is
launched (see <a href="#Fig_222">Fig. 222</a>). The keel must have its bottom edge
flush with the bottom of the boat, and a strip of hard-wood nailed
on the stern-end of the keel and bumper, as shown in the diagram.
A couple of strong screw-eyes will support the rudder.</div>

<p>After the boat is launched the</p>


<h3>Side-Supports for the Cabin May Be Erected</h3>

<p>These are "two-by-twos" and eight in number, and each 5 feet
9 inches long. Nail them securely at their lower ends to the adjoining
ribs. See that they are plumb, and fasten them temporarily
with diagonal pieces, to hold the top ends in place, while you
nail down the lower deck or flooring.</p>

<p>Now fit and nail the two 1-inch planks in place, at the bow and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
stern-end of the cabin, each of which has its top one inch above the
sides, even with the proposed deck (see dotted lines in <a href="#Fig_222">Fig. 222</a>).</p>


<h3>Use Ordinary Flooring</h3>

<div class='unindent'>or if that is not obtainable use ¾-inch pine boards, and run them
lengthwise from the bow to the front end of the cabin and along
the sides of the cabin. Then floor the cabin lengthwise from bow
to stern. This gives you a dry cabin floor, for there are 4 inches
of space underneath for bilge-water, which unless your boat is
badly made and very leaky, is plenty of room for what little water
may leak in from above or below. The two side-boards of the
cabin floor must, of course, have square places neatly cut out to
fit the uprights of the cabin. This may be done by slipping the
floor-board up against the uprights and carefully marking the
places with a pencil where they will come through the board,
and then at each mark sawing two inches in the floor plank, and
cutting out the blocks with a chisel.</div>


<h3>The Hatch</h3>

<p>Now take a "four-by-four" and saw off eight short supports
for the two 1-inch planks which support the hatch, Figs. 221 and
222. Toe-nail the middle four-by-four to the floor in such a position
that the two cross-planks (which are made to fit in the notches
E and F, <a href="#Fig_220">Fig. 220</a>) will rest on the supports. Nail the four other
supports to the side-boards of your boat, and on top of these nail
the cross-planks, as shown in the diagrams.</p>

<p>The boat is now ready for its</p>


<h3>Upper Deck</h3>

<div class='unindent'>of 1-inch pine boards. These are to be nailed on lengthwise, bow
and stern and at sides of cabin, leaving, of course, the cabin open,
as shown by the position of the boys in <a href="#Fig_222">Fig. 222</a>, and an opening,
3 feet by 2, for the hatch (<a href="#Fig_221">Fig. 221</a>). The two floors will act as
benches for the uprights of the cabin, and hold them stiff and
plumb.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>To further stiffen the frame, make two diagonals for the stern-end,
as shown in <a href="#Fig_223">Fig. 223</a>, and nail them in place.</p>


<h3>The Rafters</h3>

<div class='unindent'>or roof-rods, should extend a foot each way beyond the cabin,
hence cut them two feet longer than the cabin, and after testing
your uprights, to see that they are exactly plumb, nail the two side
roof-rods in place (see dotted lines in <a href="#Fig_222">Fig. 222</a>). The cross-pieces
at the ends, as they support no great weight, may be fitted between
the two side-rods, and nailed there.</div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 392px;"><a id="Fig_223"></a>
<img src="images/i_188.png" width="392" height="371" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 223.&mdash;End view.</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>The roof is to be made of ½-inch boards bent into a curve, and
the ridge-pole, or centre roof-rod, must needs have some support.
This is obtained by two short pieces of 2 by 4, each 6 inches long,
which are toe-nailed to the centre of each cross-rod, and the ridge-pole
nailed to their tops. At 3 feet from the upper deck the side
frame-pieces are toe-nailed to the uprights. As may be seen, there
are three two-by-fours on each side (<a href="#Fig_222">Fig. 222</a>).</p>

<p>The space between the side frame-pieces, the two middle uprights,
and side roof-rods, is where the windows are to be placed.</p>

<p>Use ½-inch (tongue and groove preferred) pine boards for
sidings, and</p>


<h3>Box In Your Cabin</h3>

<div class='unindent'>neatly, allowing space for windows on each side, as indicated.
Leave the front open. Of the same kind of boards make your
roof; the boards being light you can bend them down upon each
side and nail them to the side roof-rods, forming a pretty curve,
as may be seen in the illustration of the American boy's house-boat.</div>


<h3>This Roof</h3>

<div class='unindent'>to be finished neatly and made entirely water-proof, should be
covered with tent-cloth or light canvas, smoothly stretched over
and tacked upon the under side of the projecting edges. Three
good coats of paint will make it water-proof and pleasant to look
upon.</div>

<p>The description, so far, has been for a neatly finished craft, but
I have seen very serviceable and comfortable house-boats built of
rough lumber, in which case the curved roof, when they had one,
had narrow strips nailed over the boards where they joined each
other or was covered with tar-paper.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 224.&mdash;End view.</div>
</div>


<h3>To Contrive a Movable Front</h3>

<div class='unindent'>to your cabin, make two doors to fit and close the front opening,
but in place of hanging the doors on hinges, set them in place.
Each door should have a good strong strap nailed securely on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
inside, for a handle, and a batten or cross-piece at top and bottom
of inside surface. A 1½ by 4, run parallel to the front top
cross-frame and nailed there, just a sufficient distance from it to
allow the top of the door to be inserted between, will hold the top
of the door securely. A two-by-four, with bolt-holes near either
end to correspond with bolt-holes in the floor, will hold the bottom
when the door is pushed in place, the movable bottom-piece
shoved against it and the bolts thrust in (see <a href="#Fig_225">Fig. 225</a>, view from
inside of cabin. <a href="#Fig_226">Fig. 226</a>, side view). It will be far less work to
break in the side of the cabin than to burst in such doors, if they
are well made. These doors possess this advantage: they can be
removed and used as table-tops, leaving the whole front open to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
the summer breeze, or one may be removed, and still allow plenty
of ventilation. A moulding on deck around the cabin is not
necessary, but it will add finish and prevent the rain-water from
leaking in.</div>

<p>To lock up the boat you must set the doors from the inside,
and if you wish to leave the craft locked you must crawl out of the
window and fasten the latter with a lock.</p>

<h3>The Rudder</h3>

<div class='unindent'>and also an arrangement by which it may be worked from the
front of the boat, which, when the boat is towed, will be found
most convenient.</div>

<p>The hatch should be made of 1-inch boards, to fit snugly flush
with the deck, as in the illustration, or made of 2-inch plank,
and a moulding fitted around the opening, as shown in <a href="#Fig_222">Fig. 222</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>


<h3>A Pair of Rowlocks</h3>

<div class='unindent'>made of two round oak sticks with an iron rod in their upper ends,
may be placed in holes in the deck near the bow, and the boat can
be propelled by two oarsmen using long "sweeps," which have
holes at the proper places to fit over the iron rods projecting from
the oaken rowlocks. These rowlocks may be removed when not
in use, and the holes closed by wooden plugs, while the sweeps
can be hung at the side of the cabin, under its eaves, or lashed fast
to the roof.</div>

<img src="images/i_192.png" width="523" height="228" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 227.&mdash;Side elevation.</div>
</div>


<h3>Two or More Ash Poles</h3>

<div class='unindent'>for pushing or poling the boat over shallow water or other difficult
places for navigation are handy, and should not be left out of the
equipment. The window-sashes may be hung on hinges and
supplied with hooks and screw-eyes to fasten them open by hooking
them to the eaves when it is desired to let in the fresh air. All
window openings should be protected by wire netting to keep
out insects.</div>

<p>Two bunks can be fitted at the rear end of the cabin, one
above the other, the bottom bunk being the lid to a locker (see
<a href="#Fig_222">Fig. 222</a>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>


<h3>The Locker</h3>

<div class='unindent'>is simply a box, the top of which is just below the deck-line and
extending the full width of the cabin. It has hinges at the back,
and may be opened for the storage of luggage.</div>

<p>Over the lid blankets are folded, making a divan during the
day and a bed at night.</p>

<p>The top bunk is made like the frame of a cheap cot, but in place
of being upholstered it has a strong piece of canvas stretched
across it. This bunk is also hinged to the back of the cabin, so
that when not in use it can be swung up against the roof and fastened
there as the top berth in a sleeping-car is fastened. Four
4 by 4 posts can be bolted to the side-support at each corner of
the bottom bunk; they will amply support the top bunk, as the
legs do a table-top when the frame is allowed to rest upon their
upper ends. This makes accommodation for two boys, and
there is still room for upper and lower side bunks, the cabin
being but six feet wide. If you put bunks on both sides you will
be rather crowded, it is true, but by allowing a 1-foot passage in
the middle, you can have two side bunks and plenty of head room.
This will accommodate four boys, and that is a full crew for a boat
of this size.</p>

<p>On board a yacht I have often seen four full-grown men
crowded into a smaller space in the cabin, while the sailormen
in the fo'-castle had not near that amount of room.</p>


<h3>A More Simple Set of Plans</h3>

<p>Here the cabin is built on top of the upper deck, and there are
no bottom-ribs, the uprights being held in place by blocks nailed
to the bottom of the boat, and by the deck of the boat. This is
secure enough for well-protected waters, small lakes, and small
streams. Upon the inland streams of New York State I have seen
two-story house-boats, the cabin, or house, being only a framework
covered with canvas. One such craft I saw in central New
York, drifting downstream over a shallow riff, and as it bumped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
along over the stones it presented a strange sight. The night was
intensely dark, and the boat brightly lighted. The lights shone
through the canvas covering, and this big, luminous house went
bobbing over the shallow water, while shouts of laughter and the
"plinky-plunk" of a banjo told in an unmistakable manner of the
jolly time the crew were having.</p>


<h3>Canvas-Cabined House-Boat</h3>

<p>If you take an ordinary open scow and erect a frame of uprights
and cross-pieces, and cover it with canvas, you will have just such
a boat as the one seen in central New York. This boat may be
propelled by oars, the rowers sitting under cover, and the canvas
being lifted at the sides to allow the sweeps to work; but of course
it will not be as snug as the well-made American boy's house-boat,
neither can it stand the same amount of rough usage, wind, and
rain as the latter boat.</p>

<p>In the frontispiece the reader will notice a stove-pipe at the stern;
there is room for a small stove back of the cabin, and in fair
weather it is much better to cook outside than inside the cabin.
When you tie up to the shore for any length of time, a rude
shelter of boughs and bark will make a good kitchen on the land,
in which the stove may be placed, and you will enjoy all the fun
of a camp, with the advantage of a snug house to sleep in.</p>

<p>For the benefit of boys who doubt their ability to build a boat
of this description, it may be well to state that other lads have used
these directions and plans with successful results, and their boats
now gracefully float on many waters, a source of satisfaction and
pride to their owners.</p>


<h3>Information for Old Boys</h3>

<p>On all the Western rivers small flat-boats or scows are to be had
at prices which vary in accordance with the mercantile instincts
of the purchaser, and with the desire of the seller to dispose of his
craft. Such boats are propelled by "sweeps," a name used to
designate the long poles with boards on their outer edges that serve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
as blades and form the oars. These boats are often supplied with
a deck-house, extending almost from end to end, and if such a
house is lacking one may be built with little expense. The cabin
may be divided into rooms and the sleeping apartments supplied
with cheaply made bunks. It is not the material of the bunk
which makes it comfortable&mdash;it is the mattress in the bunk upon
which your comfort will depend. The kitchen and dining-room
may be all in one. An awning spread over the roof will make a
delightful place in which to lounge and catch the river breezes.</p>


<h3>The Cost of House-Boats</h3>

<p>The cost of a ready-made flat-bottomed house-boat is anywhere
from thirty dollars to one or more thousands. In Florida such a
boat, 40 by 20 feet, built for the quiet waters of the St. John's
River or its tributaries, or the placid lagoons, will cost eight hundred
dollars. This boat is well painted outside and rubbed down
to a fine oil finish inside; it has one deck, and the hull is used for
toilet apartments and state-rooms; the hull is well calked and all
is in good trim. Such expense is, however, altogether unnecessary&mdash;there
need be no paint or polish. All you need is a well-calked
hull and a water-tight roof of boards or canvas overhead;
cots or bunks to sleep in; chairs, stools, boxes or benches to sit
on; hammocks to loll in, and a good supply of provisions in
the larder.</p>

<p>House-boats for the open waters are necessarily more expensive.
As a rule they need round bottoms that stand well out of the water,
and are built like the hull of a ship. These boats cost as much to
build as a small yacht. From twelve to fifteen hundred dollars
will build a good house-boat, with comfortable sleeping-berths,
toilet-rooms and store-rooms below; a kitchen, dining-room, and
living-rooms on the cabin deck, with wide, breezy passageways
separating them.</p>

<p>If a bargain can be found in an old schooner with a good hull,
for two or three hundred dollars, a first-class house-boat can be
made by the expenditure of as much more for a cabin. The roofs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
of all house-boats should extend a foot or more beyond the sides
of the cabin.</p>


<h3>For People of Limited Means</h3>

<p>For people with little money to spend, these expensive boats
are as much out of reach as a yacht, but they may often be rented
for prices within the means of people in moderate circumstances.
At New York I have known a good schooner-yacht, 84 feet over all,
to be chartered for two weeks, with crew of skipper and two men,
the larder plentifully supplied with provisions and luxuries for six
people and the crew, making nine in all, at a cost of thirty-six dollars
apiece for each of the six passengers. An equally good house-boat
should not cost over twelve dollars a week per passenger for
a party of ten. In inland waters, if a boat could be rented, the
cost should not exceed seven or eight dollars a week per passenger.</p>

<p>A canal-boat is a most excellent house-boat for a pleasure party,
either on inland streams or along our coast.</p>


<h3>Street-Car Cabins</h3>

<p>Since the introduction of cable and trolley-cars the street-car
companies have been selling their old horse-cars, in some instances
at figures below the cost of the window-glass in them; so cheap,
in fact, that poor people buy them to use as woodsheds and
chicken-coops.</p>

<p>One of these cars will make an ideal cabin for a house-boat,
and can be adapted for that purpose with little or no alterations.
All it needs is a good flat-boat to rest in, and you have a palatial
house-boat.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV<br />
<small>A CHEAP AND SPEEDY MOTOR-BOAT</small></h2>

<div class='summary1'>How To Build the Jackson Glider&mdash;A Very Simple Form of Motor-Boat,
Which Will Hold Its Own in Speed With Even
Expensive Boats of Double Horse-Power</div>


<p><span class="smcap">This</span> boat is intended to slide over the top of the water and not
through it, consequently it is built in the form of a flat-bottom
scow. Order your wood dressed on both sides, otherwise it will
come with one side rough. For the side-boards we need two pine,
or cedar boards, to measure, when trimmed, 14 feet (<a href="#Fig_228">Fig. 228</a>),
and to be 16 or 18 inches wide.</p>


<h3>The Stern-Board</h3>

<div class='unindent'>when trimmed, will be 2½ feet long by 1 foot, 8½ inches wide.
It may even be a little wider, because the protruding part can be
planed down after the boat is built (<a href="#Fig_229">Fig. 229</a>).</div>

<p>To make the bow measure from the point E (<a href="#Fig_228">Fig. 228</a>) 1 foot
8½ inches and mark the point C. Measure along the same line
13½ inches and mark the point D. Next measure from B down
along the edge of the boat one inch and mark the point F. Again
measure down from B, 5¾ inches and mark the point G. With
a carpenter's pencil draw the lines F D and G C and saw these
pieces off along the dotted line (<a href="#Fig_232">Fig. 232</a>). The bow can then be
rounded at the points A and B with a sharp knife or jackplane.</p>

<p>To get the proper slant on the stern, measure from H 4½ inches
to L and saw off the triangle LHK. Make the other side board
an exact duplicate of the first one, as in <a href="#Fig_228">Fig. 228</a>. Next set these
two boards on edge, like sledge runners (<a href="#Fig_230">Fig. 230</a>), and let them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
be 2 feet, 6 inches apart (the boat will be safer if made six inches
wider, and its speed will be almost as great), which can be tested
by fitting the stern-boards between them before nailing the temporary
boards on, which are to hold them in place (<a href="#Fig_230">Fig. 230</a>). Do
not drive the nails home, but leave the heads protruding on all
temporary braces, so that they may be easily removed when
necessary.</p>

<img src="images/i_199.png" width="334" height="475" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 231.</div>
</div>

<p>Now turn the boat bottom side up and nail the bottom on, as
already described in previous chapters (<a href="#Fig_232">Fig. 232</a>). The bottom-boards
are to be so planed upon their edges that they leave V-shaped
grooves on the inside of the boat to be calked with candlewick
and putty (<a href="#Fig_231">Fig. 231</a>). Next make a shaft-log by cutting a
board in a triangular piece, as shown in <a href="#Fig_233">Fig. 233</a>, and nailing two
other pieces of board on it, and leaving a space for the shaft-rod,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
over which is nailed a duplicate of the bottom-board, as shown
in <a href="#Fig_234">Fig. 234</a>. Make the shaft-log of three thicknesses of 1-inch
plank. To make it more secure there should be a board nailed on
the inside bottom of the boat, as shown in <a href="#Fig_235">Fig. 235</a> by the dotted
lines.</p>

<p>This board is put there to strengthen the bottom and allow us
to cut a slot through for the admission of a shaft (<a href="#Fig_236">Fig. 236</a>) which
is drawn on a scale shown below
it. With the engine comes a
stuffing box, through which the
shaft passes and which prevents
the water from coming up
through the shaft-hole. The
stuffing boxes, which are furnished
to fit upon the inside of
the boat, are expensive, but one
to fit upon the stern of the shaft-log
costs but little, and will answer
all purposes.</p>



<p>Of course, when attaching the
shaft-log to the bottom, it must
be in the exact centre of the
boat. Find the centre of the
boat at the bow and stern, mark
the points and snap a chalk-line
between them. Now place the
shaft-log in position on this line and while holding that there
firmly, mark around it with a carpenter's pencil. Next lay the
shaft-log flat on its side with its edge along this line and with
your pencil mark on the bottom of the boat the exact place
where the shaft-hole must be cut to correspond with the one in the
shaft-log. As may be seen by <a href="#Fig_236">Fig. 236</a>, the shaft runs through
at an acute angle; hence the hole must be bored on a slant, or
better still a slot cut through the floor long enough to allow for
the slant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><a id="Fig_232"></a><a id="Fig_233"></a><a id="Fig_234"></a><a id="Fig_235"></a><a id="Fig_236"></a><a id="Fig_237"></a><a id="Fig_238"></a><a id="Fig_239"></a>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>The leak, which would naturally occur here is prevented by the
stuffing box which is fastened on to the stern-end of the shaft-log
where the latter protrudes for the propeller. To set the engine
in the boat it is necessary to have an engine-bed. This is made
of two pieces of board cut diagonally, upon which the engine
rests.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig_237">Fig. 237</a> shows a piece of 2-inch board and a method of sawing
it to make the duplicate pieces to form the engine-bed. The
dimension of these pieces must be obtained by measuring the
width of the engine rest, which is to be installed. The angle, of
course, must correspond to the angle of the shaft.</p>

<p>Make your own rudder of any shape that suits your fancy,
square or paddle-shaped, of a piece of galvanized iron or of wood,
as shown in the diagram; or you can simply fasten the rudder-stem
to the transom (stern-board), as is often done on row-boats
and sail-boats. If you desire to make your rudder like the one
shown here, use two pieces of galvanized pipes for your rudder-posts,
one of which fits loosely inside of the other. Make the
rudder-posts of what is known as <small><sup>3</sup>/<sub>8</sub></small>-inch (which means literally
a <small><sup>3</sup>/<sub>8</sub></small>-inch opening) and for its jacket use a ¾-inch pipe, or any two
kinds of pipe, which will allow one to turn loosely inside the other.
The smaller pipe can be bent easily by hand to suit your convenience,
after it has been thrust through the larger pipe.</p>

<p>First bend the lower end of the small pipe to fit your proposed
rudder, then remove the larger pipe and flatten the lower end of
the small one by beating it with the hammer. To bore the screw-holes
in the flattened end you will use a small tool for drilling
metal. One of these drills, which will fit any carpenter's brace,
can be procured for the cost of a few cents.</p>

<p>Drill holes through the flattened end of your pipe for the reception
of your screws, which are to secure it to the rudder. It is
now necessary to fasten a block of 2-inch plank securely to the
bottom of the boat upon the inside where the rudder-post is to be
set. This block might best be secured on with four bolts. A
hole is then bored through the block and the bottom of the boat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
a trifle smaller than the largest piece of pipe; the latter is supposed
to have screw threads upon its lower end (<a href="#Fig_238">Fig. 238</a>) so that
it may be screwed into the wood, but before doing so coat the
threads with white lead and also the inside of the hole in the block
with the same substance.</p>

<p>When the larger pipe is now screwed into the block until its
lower end is flushed with the outside bottom of the boat, the white
lead will not only make the process easier, but will tend to keep
out the moisture and water from the joint.</p>

<p>From the outside thrust the upper end of the small pipe through
the hole in the bottom until it protrudes the proper distance above
the larger pipe, and with the point of a nail scratch a mark on the
surface of the small pipe where it issues from the big one. At this
point drill a hole through the small pipe to admit a nail which is
to act as a peg to keep the helm from sliding down and jamming in
its bearings.</p>

<p>If you choose, a small seat or deck may be inserted in the stern,
through which the helm extends and which will help to steady it.
The top of the helm, or protruding ends of the small pipe may
now be bent over toward the bow, as shown in the diagram, and
by holding some hard substance under it, the end may be flattened
with a hammer and two holes drilled through the flattened end
for the rudder-line, as in <a href="#Fig_239">Fig. 239</a>. These lines work the rudder
and extend on each side of the boat through some clothes-lines
pulleys, as shown in <a href="#Fig_239">Fig. 239</a>.</p>

<p>If you slice off the ring from a common rubber hose and slip
it over the inside pipe before you fasten it in place, it will prevent
the water from spurting up through the rudder pipe when the boat
is speeding.</p>

<p>Any boat will leak if not carefully built and the simplest kind
of a craft carefully put together is as water-tight as the most finished
and expensive boat.</p>

<p>For a gasoline tank any good galvanized iron vessel will answer
if it holds five gallons or more of gasoline. It can be placed in the
bow on a rest made for it. Of course the bottom of the tank must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
be on a level or higher than the carburetor of the engine; the tank
is connected by a small copper, or block-tin pipe, which you procure
with the engine.</p>

<p>This boat, if built according to plans, should cost ten dollars or
less, not counting the cost of the engine. The cost of the latter
will vary according to the style of one you use, and whether you
get it first or second hand.</p>

<p>A ten-horse power engine drove a boat of this kind at the rate of
eighteen miles an hour.</p>

<p>For beginners, this is as far as it is safe to go in boat-building,
but thus far any one with a rudimentary knowledge of the use of
tools can go, and, if one has followed the book through from
chapter to chapter he should be a good boat-builder at</p>
